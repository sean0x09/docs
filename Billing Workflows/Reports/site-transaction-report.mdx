#### Summary

This report provides a detailed breakdown of your Stripe and recorded patient payments in three ways. It also includes write-offs.

####

#### Aggregate Metrics

This section summarizes all categories of patient payments and aligns with the patient payments reflected in other revenue graphs.

####

#### Processed Transactions

Each row represents an individual Stripe transaction. A single transaction may cover payments for multiple dates of service. Each transaction includes a "Payout ID" and an "Expected Deposit Date," which can be used to match the transaction to a bank deposit.

####

#### Transactions by Charge

Payments are grouped by the charges on a patient’s account. Each row shows a payment made toward a specific charge. A single payment in the Processed Transactions section may appear as multiple rows here, with the amount allocated to each charge.

####

#### Notes

Here is an example of how the Transactions by Charge and Processed Transactions reports differ:

- A payment of $50 is made towards two charges for dates of service 12/30 and 1/15.
