#### Summary

The collections report provides an overview of all collected amounts—both insurance and patient payments—within a specific date range for your site.

####

#### Notes

- Columns labeled with `overall_` are already aggregated and cannot be used to sum payments.

- For example, if there is a column labeled **`overall**_amount_paid` and another labeled `amount_paid`, use the `amount_paid` column for aggregation.

- If a patient payment has a recorded payment date (entered by the user), this date will be shown instead of the system-generated payment date.
- The report does not account for the date of service. It only tracks the date when the payment was posted in our system.
- Insurance payments reflect what is posted in Insights and may not correspond to actual bank deposits.
- Insurance names are based on Athelas' insurance mapping. Contact your account manager if you need to update the mapping.
- Each insurance payment may be linked to a bank deposit through our [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) banking integration. If you're interested in this feature, please reach out to Athelas staff.
