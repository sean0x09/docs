####

#### Summary

The Claim Details Export reflects the encounters listed on the [Claim Details](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view) page, representing all encounters imported into our system.

The download includes three reports, categorized by encounter, procedure, and insurance type.

A raw data sheet is also provided for validating the data specific to your practice.

#### Notes

- You cannot sum up patient payments and tie them to revenue graphs in this report. Miscellaneous patient payments are excluded. Only patient payments linked to PR (Patient Responsibility) generated from a remittance are included.
- The total billed amount is based on the latest primary claim submission for each encounter.
**The filters available here differ from the filters on the Claim Details page**. Here, you’ll select the report’s **inclusive** date range, i.e. ‘Start Date’ and ‘End Date.’

If you click `Download CSV` on the [Claim Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view), however, it will respond to the **exclusive** filters you’ve set. These filters include ‘Submission Before,’ ‘Submission After,’ ‘Payment Posted Before,’ and ‘Payment Posted After.’
