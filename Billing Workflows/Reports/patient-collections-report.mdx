#### Summary

This report is intended to help measure performance of front desk collections during a specified time frame. It shows outstanding charges, suggested charges, and other charges, as well as the amount actually collected at the time of the appointment.

After downloading and opening the CSV, you will see two tabs: ‘**Detailed Collections**’ and ‘**Summary of Collections**.’

- **Detailed Collections** gives you an appointment-level breakdown of collections
- **Summary of Collections** aggregates these details which you can use to assess your practice’s overall upfront collections performance
