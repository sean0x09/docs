Submitted Claims Report


<img alt="" src="/images/submitted-claims-report/submitted-claims-report-1.png"><h4><br></h4><h4>Summary</h4><p>This report includes only submitted claims. If an encounter does not have a corresponding claim submission, it will not appear in the report.</p><p><br></p><h3>Notes</h3><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>For a claim to appear, it must be submitted and have a submission date recorded in the database.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Insurance details (primary/secondary) are based on the claim submission, not the encounter. If the encounter's insurance information changes later, the original insurance at the time of claim submission remains the payer.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Information such as provider, patient, facility, site, and date of service is pulled from the encounter, not the claim submission.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pro Tip: You can submit multiple claims for the same patient on the same date of service!</strong> They simply need to be categorized differently.</p><p>To do so…</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Go to the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/encounter-details">Encounter Details page</a> and select an encounter or create a new one.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>In the ‘Configurations’ section, you’ll find the ‘Category’ dropdown.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The <strong>‘Category’ dropdown</strong> will be available for modification if you’re editing or creating a new encounter in such a situation.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>This extra level of distinction helps reduce the chance of rejection—many payers assume that the claims are duplicates otherwise.</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>As these categories are global and cannot be altered, don’t fret too much about which category you choose. Just select the closest match.
