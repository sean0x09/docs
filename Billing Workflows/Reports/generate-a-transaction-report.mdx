After you click Confirm, a Payment History Report folder will download to your computer.

It contains CSV files of **Aggregate Metrics, Processed Transactions and Transactions by Charge**. It also contains a PDF of the Transactions by Charge for an easy viewing experience.

- **Aggregate Metrics** shows a single line of all totals in all categories — Outstanding Balance, Paid Cash, etc.
- **Processed Transactions** shows all payments, refunds and write-offs that successfully went through.
- **Transactions by Charge** shows individual charges assigned to patients, including any credits added.
