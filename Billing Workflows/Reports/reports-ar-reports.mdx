<h4>What is A/R?</h4><p><strong>Accounts Receivable (A/R)</strong> simply refers to all uncollected charges from both patients and insurance companies.</p><img alt="" src="/images/ar-reports/ar-reports-1.png" /><h4><br /></h4><h4>Summary</h4><p>This comprehensive report includes primary/secondary insurance A/R, as well as patient A/R data. If this report does not meet your needs, please contact our staff.</p><p><strong>A/R is calculated as follows</strong>:</p><p>A/R = Charges - Insurance Payments - Patient Payments - Insurance Adjustments.</p><p>❗ A/R Reports are generally very large and will take time to download.</p><h4><br /></h4><h4>How to Do It</h4><p>First, click the download icon for the A/R Report on the My Reports page.</p><img alt="" src="/images/ar-reports/ar-reports-2.png" /><p>Set all filters (scroll down in the window to find them, as there are many) and click <code>Download</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/ar-reports/ar-reports-3.png" /><img alt="" src="/images/ar-reports/ar-reports-4.png" /><p>Open the downloaded CSV file that in Excel or a similar program. You will see A/R divided into four categories on the first tab, with about ten more tabs of data available at the bottom, depending on the filters you set.</p><img alt="" src="/images/ar-reports/ar-reports-1.png" /><p><br /></p><h4>Categories of AR</h4><p>The first tab, Monthly A/R Charges, is essentially a summary page. The first of the five sections is labeled ‘<strong>All Monthly A/R Charges</strong>.’ It is the sum total of the other four: Insurance, Miscellaneous, Appointment, and Self-Pay charges.</p><p>Insurance encompasses all external payers. Miscellaneous, Appointment, and Self-Pay charges are all patient responsibility.</p><p>Note that this first tab will be unaffected by any date filters you may have set. The subsequent tabs, however, will reflect your date range parameters.</p><h4><br /></h4><h4>Filter Notes</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>When filtering patient charges with date type by date of submission, the date on which patient charges were created is used.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The “A/R Mode Types” do not affect how Patient A/R is determined.</p></li></ul><h4><br /></h4><h4>Aging Mode Definitions</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Latest Date of Submission</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Age of the insurance charges is determined by the date of submission of the latest claim submission.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Age of patient charges is determined by the date the charge was added to the patient’s balance.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4><br /></h4><h4>Filters Supported</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>A/R Mode Type</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Date Range: Date of Service &amp; (First or Latest) Date of Submission</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Date Posted</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Patients</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Providers</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Facilities</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Insurance companies</p></li></ul>
