####

#### Summary

This report includes only submitted claims. If an encounter does not have a corresponding claim submission, it will not appear in the report.

### Notes

- For a claim to appear, it must be submitted and have a submission date recorded in the database.
- Insurance details (primary/secondary) are based on the claim submission, not the encounter. If the encounter's insurance information changes later, the original insurance at the time of claim submission remains the payer.
- Information such as provider, patient, facility, site, and date of service is pulled from the encounter, not the claim submission.
**Pro Tip: You can submit multiple claims for the same patient on the same date of service!** They simply need to be categorized differently.

To do so…

- Go to the [Encounter Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/encounter-details) and select an encounter or create a new one.
- In the ‘Configurations’ section, you’ll find the ‘Category’ dropdown.
- The **‘Category’ dropdown** will be available for modification if you’re editing or creating a new encounter in such a situation.

- This extra level of distinction helps reduce the chance of rejection—many payers assume that the claims are duplicates otherwise.

- As these categories are global and cannot be altered, don’t fret too much about which category you choose. Just select the closest match. It simply needs to be different than other categories already associated with other such encounters.
