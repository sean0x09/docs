#### What is A/R?

**Accounts Receivable (A/R)** simply refers to all uncollected charges from both patients and insurance companies.

####

#### Summary

This comprehensive report includes primary/secondary insurance A/R, as well as patient A/R data. If this report does not meet your needs, please contact our staff.

**A/R is calculated as follows**:

A/R = Charges - Insurance Payments - Patient Payments - Insurance Adjustments.

❗ A/R Reports are generally very large and will take time to download.

#### How to Do It

First, click the download icon for the A/R Report on the My Reports page.

Open the downloaded CSV file that in Excel or a similar program. You will see A/R divided into four categories on the first tab, with about ten more tabs of data available at the bottom, depending on the filters you set.

#### Categories of AR

The first tab, Monthly A/R Charges, is essentially a summary page. The first of the five sections is labeled ‘**All Monthly A/R Charges**.’ It is the sum total of the other four: Insurance, Miscellaneous, Appointment, and Self-Pay charges.

Insurance encompasses all external payers. Miscellaneous, Appointment, and Self-Pay charges are all patient responsibility.

Note that this first tab will be unaffected by any date filters you may have set. The subsequent tabs, however, will reflect your date range parameters.
