Target Allowed Amounts


<blockquote><p><em>“Look, if I made more than $165.00 on this claim, I’m not looking to chase the rest.”</em></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to balancing encounters and closing out A/R, Athelas starts by automatically resolving any denial adjustments that we’ve confirmed are not realistically workable. This strategy works well for many common adjustments, however as we get into the long-tail of <em>thousands of individual adjustment combinations</em>, this approach starts to become less effective.</p><p>This is why we’re implementing a new complimentary strategy, the <strong>Target Allowed Amount</strong>.</p><h3><br></h3><h4>What is a Target Allowed Amount?</h4><p>A Target Allowed Amount (TAA) is our answer to the question:</p><blockquote><p>How much do I realistically expect to earn for this claim?</p></blockquote><p>With TAAs, Athelas is able to quickly identify encounters where we’re satisfied with the payouts, then write off the balance and finalize the encounter. This allows us to resolve a large number of encounters where no further action is needed, reducing unnecessary inflation of a practice’s A/R metrics.</p><h3><br></h3><h4>How is a TAA different from a Contracted Rate?</h4><p>While these concepts are similar, a Contracted Rate is the letter of the law for how much a payer is <em>supposed</em> <em>to</em> pay for a procedure. But in practice, a variety of factors cause them to pay less. TAA on the other hand is more practical: it’s the amount you designate as the minimum your practice will accept for a claim configuration and not pursue further payment. If the payer exceeds that amount, even better.</p><p>Contracted Rate and TAA amounts are often nearly the same, but TAA tends to be slightly lower.</p><h3><br></h3><h4>How do TAAs work?</h4><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Athelas provides an internal tool to its Operations Team that lists a practices most common <strong>claim configurations</strong>, which are a unique combination of procedures (cpt/mod/units), payer, and place of service.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The Ops team can review all the <strong>allowed amounts</strong> we’ve received for this particular claim configuration, discuss with your practice, and together specify an acceptable TAA.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>When the <strong>Adjustment Rules Engine System</strong> (<strong>ARES</strong>) finds an encounter that matches the claim configuration and has an allowed amount greater than the specified TAA, all remaining non-PR balances will be written off, resolving the encounter.</p></li></ol><h3><br></h3><h4>Are we required to use TAAs?</h4><p>Definitely not! Target Allowed Amounts are an <em>optional</em> tool meant to give you greater accuracy in your A/R metrics, help your team focus on working the most important claims, and get PR to your patients sooner.</p><p>Athelas strongly recommends using TAAs, but in the end the choice is yours.</p><p>If you and your practice would like to start setting Target Allowed Amounts to get a clearer picture of your A/R and resolve more encounters, talk to your Account Manager and we’ll get a TAA session set up.</p>
