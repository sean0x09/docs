<h4>At a Glance</h4><p>Establishing <strong>Suggested PR Rules</strong> can save your staff a lot of time, as they’ll no longer need to manually look up or compare fee schedules and insurance information.</p><p>These rules determine things like suggested copay, coinsurance, the prioritization of deductible or copay, etc. based on your criteria.</p><h3><br /></h3><h3>Walkthrough: How to Set Suggested Charge Rules</h3><p>Currently, you can set Suggested Charge Rules via the <strong>Suggested PR Rules</strong> tab in <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/patient-responsibility-settings">Patient Responsibility Settings</a>. Click <code>Add Rule</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-1.png" /><p><strong>For this example</strong>, imagine you want a Suggested Charge Rule that:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Sets a $10 copay that prioritizes any remaining family deductible, but</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Only for patients 65 years of age or older, and</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>To only apply when the appointment is for a Diagnostic X-Ray.</p></li></ul><p>To begin, give your rule a name and level of priority.</p><p>Higher numerical values indicate higher priority. For example, a rule with Priority 3 will override a conflicting rule of Priority 2.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-2.png" /><p>In the Actions block, choose to <code>Set Copay Amount in USD Cents</code> and enter 1000, to equal $10.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-3.png" /><p>Then, click <code>Add Action</code> and select ‘Prioritize Family Deductible’ from the new dropdown menu.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-4.png" /><p>Now, add the <strong>conditions</strong> that must be met to activate this rule.</p><p>By default, a single-statement block will be displayed.</p><p>The <strong>best practice for setting rules with several distinct conditions that must all be met</strong>, like what we’re doing here, would be to delete the single-statement condition block and use a multi-statement condition block instead.</p><p>Under <code>Condition Type</code>, in this case, you may choose ‘All’ or ‘Any,’ as we will use a multi-statement condition anyway. If you need to edit the rule later, you can change whether ‘All’ conditions must be met or if only ‘Any’ conditions must be met to activate the rule.</p><p>Under <code>Variable</code>, choose ‘Patient Age’ and set it greater than or equal to 65.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-5.png" /><p>Almost done!</p><p>Click <code>Add Statement</code>.</p><p>For this Variable, choose Appointment Type and set it equal to 4 (the STC for Diagnostic X-Ray. Be sure to look up and enter the proper STC for your rule if you use this or a related variable).</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-6.png" /><p>Click <code>Save</code>. Now you can view your rule in the Rules list, and edit, copy or archive it from there.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules/how-to-create-suggested-pr-rules-7.png" /><h4>Suggested Charges Features</h4><p><strong>Features Supported:</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Pre-visit rules to customize suggested charge</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>ability to suggest last remit amount</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Incorporating benefits into final charge</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Autofilling suggested charges at checkout</p></li></ul><p><strong>Features In Development:</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Dynamic deductible rules</p></li></ul><p><strong>Features Not Supported:</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Procedure based charges</p></li></ul><h4>Suggested Charge Rules: Actions and Conditions Reference List</h4><p>Below is a list of all Actions and Conditions currently available for Suggested Charge Rules.
