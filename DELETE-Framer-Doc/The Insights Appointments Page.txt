The Insights Appointments Page

<h4>At a Glance</h4><p>The tools provided in our <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v3/appointments" target="_blank"><strong>Appointments</strong></a> page will empower your practice to drastically decrease eligibility-related denials, increase up-front patient payments, and reduce the amount of time that front desk staff spend chasing down patient responsibility.</p><p>The Appointments page under Daily Operations allows you to:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Determine the eligibility of a patient’s insurance</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Check their outstanding balances</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Collect copays and pre-pay coinsurance and deductibles</p></li></ol><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/YNl77uirhpaSEoweIRlHkZZnGI.png"><p><br></p><h4>Best Practices</h4><p><strong>1.</strong> Each week, <strong>review the eligibility results</strong> for the upcoming appointments. Reach out to any patients whose insurance appears to be invalid.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> At the end of the day, <strong>check to see if any patients did not pay their copays</strong>. If this is the case, use the ‘Request payment by text message’ (or email) payment option to send them a belated opportunity to pay.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> When a patient hasn’t met their deductible, <strong>collect an upfront deductible deposit</strong> while they’re in the office. You can set a default value to charge for unmet deductibles using your <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/patient-responsibility-settings?settings_tab=PRE_VISIT_RULES" target="_blank">Suggested PR Rules</a>.</p><p><br></p><h4>Patient Eligibility Summary</h4><p>Every night, the Athelas will automatically pull in a list of your practice’s upcoming appointments and load them into your Appointments page. Then, our systems analyze all detected insurance to confirm whether your patients do in fact have eligible coverage.</p><p>The results are visible on each row of the appointments tab as a high-level summary.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Active</strong>/<strong>Inactive/Inconclusive</strong> determination, indicated by a green checkmark, a red warning, or a yellow warning, respectively.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Primary, secondary, and tertiary insurance will be displayed in their corresponding order from left to right.</p></li></ul><p>The results also show any patient responsibility and outstanding balances.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/1I7TxYoEuKm4LDh0dfatJaOkA.gif"><p>Eligibility can also be re-run through the Appointment Details section of Calendar</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/HKkOJaM5CLI1PmA4wDB7GAJsCcs.png"><h4>Appointments Page Toolbar</h4><p>You will notice a colorful toolbar at the top of the page, with buttons for adding a ‘Walk-in Patient,’ running a ‘Live Eligibility Check’ and so forth. The available guides for each of these features are linked below.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/PQURKIa79L4t6tTdNPbpMbuSUg8.png"><p><strong>Download</strong>: This button downloads a printable PDF appointment schedule based on the filters you’ve set. For example, if your only filter is the one set by default showing all appointments for today, the PDF will include only today’s appointments. This PDF may take up to a minute to download depending on how many appointments are included.</p><p><br></p><h4>Appointments Page Filters</h4><p>By default, your appointments will be filtered to display the current date and hour.</p><p>You can, of course, close this filter or apply others (patient, provider, facility, other dates and times, etc.) to see any appointments matching your preferences.</p><p><em>You can also filter appointments by typing ‘Today,’ ‘Tomorrow,’ and ‘Yesterday.’</em></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/JFZevbVAdVaXgmXfJB0oOYBE3Y.png"><h4><br></h4><h4>Individual Appointment Details</h4><p>If you <strong>click on an appointment, away from the patient’s name,</strong> you will see all information pertaining to this appointment. From here, you can view their eligibility status and rerun eligibility, view their raw benefits, proceed to collect a payment, and see details about all of these items.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/3M1ZrW30SVbU5FZBzs2zEPFMtI.png"><p>On this page, there is an Actions dropdown menu in the top right corner with the following options:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Appointment Type</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Describe what kind of appointment the patient has here</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Appointment Status</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Scheduled</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Cancelled</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>No Show</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Patient Insurance</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Edit or create a new insurance for the patient here.

A patient’s eligibility may also return as ‘<strong>Inconclusive</strong>,’ in which case it may be worth double checking that their information matches that in your practice’s EHR.</p><p>The following sections will appear if relevant to the appointment:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The ‘Rules Applied’ section shows which raw benefits apply to this patient.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>If there are any ‘Appointment Rules’ set, for example if a particular Service Type Code should apply for this appointment, they show up in the corresponding section.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The ‘Eligibility Rules Applied’ section shows details about how Athelas prioritizes elements of a patient’s eligibility.</p></li></ul><p>Note that you can also view and edit Visit Limits for this appointment type.

Once you've selected charges, click 'Confirm' to move on to the payment window.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/hJfKkZBoL12acpZ2aRX376v8ZLs.png"><p><br></p><h4>Payment Methods</h4><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/CLM2uBUiiYmhkw1JJG6vWkrT4bs.png"><p>When you’re ready to take payment, you’ve got options.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Request via Email</strong>: Send the patient an email of their charges with a secure link to pay.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Request via Text</strong>: Send a text message with a mobile-friendly payment link.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Pay via Credit Card</strong>: Use a saved credit card if the patient has one, or you can manually enter credit card details and charge them.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Athelas Card Reader</strong>: Use your on-premise card swiper and the patient’s card will automatically be saved for future use.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Record Payment:</strong> And lastly, if you’re taking payment via cash, check, or a credit card reader <em>not connected to Athelas</em>, you can record the payment here to keep your records accurate.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Important!</strong> If you take external payment and do not record it in Athelas, future PR collection attempts will be inaccurate as Athelas will not know what portion of PR has previously been paid. <em>This tends to irritate everyone involved, so be sure to record any external payments!</em></p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Add a Discount: </strong>For custom line items only, not standard PR like copay, coinsurance, or deductible.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Apply credits: </strong>The patient's total available credits balance will appear here, if they have available credits.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Add note to this payment: </strong>In case further explanation is needed</p></li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Feature:</strong> <em>Send Welcome Message</em></p><p>When completing a payment you’ve got a checkbox option to send the patient a welcome text message that encourages them to save the number in their phone. This will help them feel more comfortable when they receive future text messages requesting payment for their patient responsibility.</p><p><strong>Note that if your card reader is down, you can still enter card information manually to collect payments</strong>. Simply select the <code>Pay via Credit Card</code> option, review the charges, and then enter the patient’s card information.</p><p><strong>Skip Payment</strong></p><p>If you need to skip a payment, click ‘<strong>Skip Payment</strong>.'</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/9JffBFzxhiJf8uO0L45rT2Huljg.png"><p>A <strong>reason for the skipped payment is required,</strong> so fill it out accordingly and click ‘Confirm.’</p><p><br></p><h4>Send a Receipt</h4><p>Once you’ve collected payment you can either download the receipt or send it directly to the patient via email and text message.
