The Review Charges Page

<h4>At a Glance</h4><p><em><strong>This page may be accessible only to Administrators and Billing Managers at your practice.</strong></em></p><p>When payments get posted in Insights, the vast majority are handled by our rules engines. They require no manual intervention to go from submission to finalization. However, insurance payments can sometimes conflict with each other, be insufficient, or otherwise not comply with the rules established in the rules engines.</p><p>Cases like these require manual review and will end up on the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/review-charges">Review Charges page</a>. Insights provides you with several tools to get these cases back on track for finalization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Best Practices</strong></p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Depending on your staff’s bandwidth and how quickly charges generally change in your industry (some PT offices, for example, tend to see significant fluctuations in deductible charges as days pass), Athelas recommends <strong>reviewing charges</strong> <strong>at least once a week</strong>. This ensures that these claims will resolve into payments for your practice in a timely manner.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>If you notice patterns with the same kinds of claims coming in for manual review, talk to your account manager to see if a rule can be created to handle such cases. Ideally, automation will do as much of the heavy lifting with claims as possible. &lt;/aside&gt;</p></li></ol><h3><br></h3><h3>Features of the Page</h3><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/AdVo7AYtS8IQ3B9wP0YiqiQGOBo.png"><p>Some things you’ll notice when you land on the Review Charges page:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Red highlighted patients</strong></p><p>These patients are either self-pay or their eligibility check returned an inconclusive result.

This means that you’ll have choices beyond the Athelas suggested charge, as well as more context and detail about each charge option, when the payer provides such information.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/qozSJxVi117S8R5EhraKbTJlg.png"><p><br></p><h4>Review Suggested Charges Section</h4><p>Here, you can review the following charge options.
