Navigating the Rejections Page

<h4>At a Glance</h4><p>This overview will cover the main features of the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/rejections"><strong>Rejections page</strong></a> on Athelas Insights, as well as some of the reasons for rejection and, when applicable, which subsequent courses of action are available to you.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/tk6RcNoWikj9Zo02fZdAMIE.png"><h2>Overview of Rejections</h2><p>Claims can be <strong>rejected by a clearinghouse</strong> for a number of reasons before they are sent to insurance companies for either approval or denial.</p><p>In rare cases, an error will slip past a clearinghouse and be rejected directly by the payer.</p><p>Here is a visual reference for the flow of this section of a claim’s life cycle.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Vwxo2a3YgR2Q79N8fcTwl1gMgpo.png"><p><br></p><h2>Rejection Categories</h2><p>Rejections are sorted into <strong>four categories</strong>, all visible within their corresponding tab on the page:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>More Info Required</strong></p><p>This is where all rejected claims will appear that require timely further action by your practice.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Athelas Responsibility</strong></p><p>Athelas already has the necessary information to handle these rejections and resubmit them.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Not Workable</strong></p><p>Rejections can be deemed ‘Not Workable’ for a variety of reasons. For example, sometimes a duplicate claim has already been processed by an external source, or perhaps information was not provided to the payer within their mandated time frame. More on these rejections later in this overview.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Written Off</strong></p><p>For these rejections, someone in your practice has voluntarily chosen not to pursue collection from either the patient or payer.</p></li></ul><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/jZlwePzk8Eah5LT0dMeq3TouSs.png"><p> ❗ Note: The <strong>only</strong> rejections requiring <strong>timely</strong> <strong>further action</strong> by a practice are those in the ‘<strong>More Info Required</strong>’ category. Clearing out the ‘Not Workable’ category is also important but not as time-sensitive.</p><h4>Common Features and Functions Across Category Tabs</h4><h4>Filters</h4><p>When you click into a tab, you will see a section of <strong>filters</strong> at the top, followed by rejected claims organized by month.</p><p>Clicking into one of these months will automatically apply a filter covering that month. To see all rejected claims again, simply click the X on the filter.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ikZ74NMmSFzNEJ0NT5Io1aMwHk.png"><h4><br></h4><h4>Rejection Groups</h4><p>Lower on the page you can see groups, categorized according to their insurance name, rejection reason, and listed in order of greatest to least total affected charges.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Un2t68Xb226wlT7BAc0E2CD7k.png"><p><br></p><p>Clicking into one of these groups will provide further information on the exact claims affected, the full reason for rejection, and how to fix the claims for resubmission.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/qO8yx3QAgIwGRH3dGbw0O0npQA.png"><p><br></p><p>In this example, your practice would need to provide the subscriber, policy, and contract numbers for this group of claims before resubmitting.</p><h4>Actions Menu</h4><p>When you tick the box next to at least one rejected claim in a group, the ‘<strong>Actions</strong>’ menu will become available. This menu allows you to recategorize the selected claim(s) within Rejections, or resubmit them.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/oIVIqkGaVigt9r9xXmaSJytFdPc.png"><p><br></p><h4>Bulk Resubmission</h4><p>Once you are confident that you have made <strong>all necessary changes</strong> to the claims you would like to resubmit, you may <strong>resubmit them in bulk</strong>.</p><h4>More Info Required tab</h4><p>This tab contains rejections that require your practice to provide further information in a timely manner.</p><h4>Filters</h4><p>You can filter results by initial submission date, billing type, patient name, etc.</p><p>Below the standard filters, you will see the following tabs for rejections:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Not Started</strong></p><p>When a claim is rejected because it requires further action from your practice, it will land in this <strong>‘Not Started’</strong> category.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Updated in EHR</strong></p><p>These are rejections that your practice has touched and a staff member has marked as ‘Updated in EHR.’ <strong>Please</strong> <strong>update rejected claims in your EHR </strong><em><strong>before</strong></em><strong> marking them as ‘Updated in EHR.’</strong> This will create less confusion later if a claim marked as such is resubmitted and rejected again for mismatched EHR information.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Blocked</strong></p><p>Claims in the ‘Blocked’ category have been moved here by your practice. These are rejections that your practice has indicated it cannot take action to fix, and help from Athelas is required. To indicate that these rejections cannot be salvaged, move them to ‘<strong>Written Off</strong>’ status. More on that at the end of this guide.</p></li></ul><p>You can also choose to view all rejections at once.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/MebYSIGxjGNb5SbqXJFGZaQm0Oo.png"><h4>Take Action to Fix a Rejection</h4><p>To find out what changes are required, <strong>click the dropdown icon</strong> next to a group and look at the ‘Rejection Reason.’</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/xVPkmE9GC2NhBiEJrLp0yQ4LIw.png"><p>In this case, we can see that 42 claims have been rejected due to patient <strong>ineligibility for benefits for the submitted dates of service</strong>. The total charges associated with these rejections amount to $9.5k.</p><p>The rejection reason then directs you to double check that patient and subscriber information on the claim is identical to that on their ID card before attempting resubmission.</p><h4>Athelas Responsibility tab</h4><p>This section allows you to view the rejections on which Athelas is working. You can <strong>click the dropdown</strong> to view the rejection reason for each group of claims here as well and see the next steps Athelas will take before resubmitting the claims.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/FAif4H0geI8bDmVSIsC9dEkLk.png"><p>In this example, 64 claims were rejected due to missing property and casualty claim numbers, which are required for worker’s compensation and auto accident bills. Athelas will work to reduce this number to 0.</p><p> ❗ Athelas aims to clear <strong>rejected</strong> claims in the ‘<strong>Athelas Responsibility</strong>’ category within <strong>15 days</strong> (for <strong>denied</strong> claims in the same category on the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/denials">Denials</a> page, the clearance target is 21 days).</p><h4>Not Workable tab</h4><p>The two kinds of rejections that fall into the ‘Not Workable’ category can be described as either <strong>Standard</strong> or <strong>Regrettable</strong>.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Standard</strong> applies to claims that are unworkable due to a technicality, such as a duplicate claim or a claim already processed by an external source.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Regrettable</strong> applies to claims that could have been salvaged but were not, by either Athelas or the practice. For example, claims for which further information was required but not provided in a timely manner per a payer’s specifications would fall into this category.</p></li></ul><p> ❗ Claims are only explicitly categorized this way after a <strong>denial</strong>, not a rejection. Therefore, you will not see these categories listed until a claim is on the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/denials">Denials</a> page.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZdrUq5dQmMbp2ahnwrEE24YG4hk.png"><p>In this example, we can see that this claim was rejected as it is a duplicate of a previously processed claim.</p><h4>Written Off tab</h4><p>Generally, claims will be <strong>denied</strong> before they are written off, but in some cases rejections will also be written off. Charges are written off when a practice voluntarily chooses not to collect payment from either the patient or payer. Writing off a rejection is essentially the same as declaring that it will never be pursued and closing it out.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/e8VYg8qBSqKfXM42jmwNmq2u4G4.png"><p>We can see in the dropdown that this claim was submitted with a formatting issue that was not fixed.</p><h4>In Conclusion</h4><p>The Rejections page will help your <strong>prioritize</strong> your <strong>most actionable rejections</strong> and <strong>generate more revenue</strong> for your practice. It allows you to take decisive action to resubmit claims, giving you the best chance capture revenue you are owed.</p><h4>Features Supported</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Denials reviewed and worked by the Athelas team within 21 days from the claim’s posted date</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Rejections reviewed and worked by the Athelas team within 14 days from the rejection</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Dedicated Denials Expert assigned to each account to monitor metrics and trends on the backend for non-Direct Connect sites</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Auto-adjust non-Federal denials stuck in site’s queue after 3 months of no touch from the customer</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Coding Experts to provide recommendations on claims denied due to coding issues</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Denial Experts building out and managing clients’ Rules Engines through close monitoring of incoming rejections/denied claims</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>View rejections broken down by reason, category, and owner</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>View rejections grouped my month and reason</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Download rejections csv</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Bulk resubmit</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Write off claim</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Update encounter in Insights</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Mark rejections with tag indicating its status and owner</p></li></ul><h4>Features In Development</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>AI calling bots that call insurance companies for more information on denied claims</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>AI calling bots that call patients for updated insurance information on eligibility-related denials</p></li></ul><h4>Features Not Supported</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Athelas personnel calling patients directly for updated insurance information</p><h4><br></h4></li></ul><h4><br></h4><p><br></p>
