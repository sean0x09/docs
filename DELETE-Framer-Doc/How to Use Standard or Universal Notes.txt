How to Use Standard or Universal Notes

<h4>At a Glance</h4><p>Insights allows you to add notes to specific encounters, or have them appear across all instances of a patient’s presence on Insights. You can also tag specific colleagues so they receive a notification about your note.</p><p><br></p><h3>Standard Notes</h3><p>Wherever you see the speech bubble icon in the upper right corner of a window in Insights, you can leave a note. In this example, we’ll leave a note about a specific appointment from the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v3/appointments">Appointments page</a>.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/8p3RuC9564SSHjQM2C5v87ytW0.png"><p>If there are already notes on this item, you’ll see a counter on the speech bubble icon. Blue for notes older than 48 hours, red for newer notes.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/hhxmevPTUMtARj90eFnTapI9Jfc.png"><p>Click the speech bubble icon and type your note.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/y9W7YNwnLfgT4adlGfgPW2AZs0.png"><p>Now you can see your standard note by clicking back into the speech bubble icon.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/U9nXYtmxP9JjwsZ2dF24ZWE5Q.png"><h3><br></h3><h3>Universal Notes</h3><p>Universal notes will appear in all note windows for this patient: their account, appointments, encounters, claims, etc.</p><p>They can be made through the same process as standard notes, except that you need to check the box at the bottom of the window to ‘Make Universal Note.’</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/58XkUy2N4I4k5EppYBQedeJzK8.png"><p>After checking the universal note box and clicking ‘Send,’ you will find your note on every one of this patient’s note windows.</p><p>In this example, we see it showing up in their patient profile, even though the note was written on a specific appointment.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/QhvsAezssyHtVKw8JEypUiQOfQg.png"><h3>Tagging Other Staff in Notes</h3><p>To ensure a particular coworker sees a note, you can tag them by typing ‘@’ followed by their name in the note. You can select their name once it appears without typing it out in full.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/vtlDGV6Hu6XGT35MoBhz72TiVY.png"><p>Once they’re tagged, a notification will appear as a message in their notification center.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/AkaRc1FlCgujvJUM99GWsk2Lxs.png"><p><em>Currently, only employees from your institution can be tagged, not Athelas staff.</em></p><p><br></p><h3>In Conclusion</h3><p>Notes in Insights are a powerful way of conveying information exactly where it pertains. They are an efficient way of communicating in any level of specificity, whether you need to tell a particular coworker about a particular encounter or inform all staff about a patient in general. Use them often!</p>
