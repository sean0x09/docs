#### What is EDI?

As stated by the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.notion.so/Billing-Team-Wiki-3ac36d8d5d33420a8d2e90fa1523f9c6?pvs=21)…

💡 **Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the** **automated transfer of data** in a specific format following specific data content rules **between a health care provider and Medicare**, or between Medicare and another health care plan.

In some cases, that transfer may take place with the assistance of a clearinghouse or billing service that represents a provider of health care or another payer.

EDI transactions are transferred via computer either to or from Medicare. Through use of EDI, both Medicare and health care providers can process transactions faster and at a lower cost.

Essentially, **EDI is remittance information from the payer**. It is also known as an 835 file.

#### Why Do I Need EDI Files?

Generally, billing staff will use EDI files to post payments into their system for any remittances received by Athelas.

Athelas automatically posts these to our claims in [Insights](https://insights.athelas.com/overall).

#### Here’s How to Download EDI Files

💡 The toggles at the bottom of this Remittance Viewer allow you to **include or exclude Non-Athelas Claims** as well as those **Unposted to EHR**. You can also choose to hide **Non-Clearinghouse Remittances**, like any that may come directly from the payer (EOBs, for example) or manual entries.

You’ll receive an email with a zip file containing your EDIs.
