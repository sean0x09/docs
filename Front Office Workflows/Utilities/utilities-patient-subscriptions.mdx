<h4>At a Glance</h4><p>Some of the most reliable sources of revenue for many practices are <em>subscriptions</em>. Whether you’re charging for ongoing treatment plans, nutritional supplements, or anything in between, subscriptions can increase predictability in your practice’s income. The only challenge is that charging for subscriptions <em>can be a real hassle</em>.</p><p>That’s why Athelas built our <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/recurring-payments">Patient Subscriptions</a> system. From this interface you can:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Create templates</strong> — these are the subscription programs you’ll enroll your patients in.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Enroll patients</strong> — putting them on one of your subscription plans so they’ll be automatically charged at a frequency of your choosing.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Troubleshoot failed payments</strong> — when card details fail, they’ll be added to a list of subscriptions to address so your team can get payments back on track.</p></li></ol><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-1.png" /><h4>Best Practices</h4><p><strong> 1.</strong> If you have a particular subscription you use over and over again, <strong>start by adding a template</strong> for it. This will save your staff a lot of time and increase accuracy. Patients can always get customized plans if necessary. </p><p><strong>2. </strong>Although most practices run subscriptions on a monthly basis, you also have the option automatically charge on a <strong>weekly</strong> or even <strong>daily</strong> basis.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>3.</strong> We recommend <strong>checking for failing payments on a weekly basis</strong> to make sure no patients have quietly stopped paying for the services they’re receiving.</p><h4>Feature Walkthrough</h4><h4>1. Create / Manage Templates</h4><p>If you’re going to be using the same subscription plan over and over, start by creating a template:</p><p>From the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/recurring-payments">Recurring Payments</a> page, go into the Subscriptions tab and click Template Settings.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-2.png" /><p>Here you’ll see a list of your existing plans. To create a new plan click ‘Create Template’.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-3.png" /><p>Fill in all required information.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-4.png" /><p>Click Confirm and the plan will be added to your list! From here you can also edit or delete your template.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-5.png" /><p>Back on the Recurring Payments page, you can click Create Subscription Plan and the template will now appear as an option when you’re enrolling patients in a subscription.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-6.png" /><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Once you enroll a patient in a subscription plan using a template, editing the template will not make changes to those patients’ active subscriptions.</p><p>This has two major benefits:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>It allows all patient subscriptions to be 100% customizable. You can start with a template and then make changes at the patient level without affecting the template.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>It means you can occasionally increase your subscription fee for new patients without automatically hiking rates for previous patients. Old patients will continue to be billed at their established rate.</p></li></ol><h4>2. Enroll Patients in Subscriptions</h4><p>From the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/recurring-payments">Recurring Payments</a> page, click Create Subscription Plan.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-7.png" /><p>Fill in the required information, and choose your new template if you like.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-8.png" /><p>Click Confirm and you’re all set! The patient will be charged for the first time on the date you selected.</p><h4>3. Edit, Cancel, or Pause Subscriptions</h4><p>From time to time you’ll want to make modifications to your existing subscriptions, and you can do this with ease in the subscription detail view.</p><p>First, click the subscription you want to modify.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-9.png" /><p>From here, you can adjust any of the parameters of your subscription. You can also <strong>Pause</strong> or <strong>Cancel</strong> the subscription.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-10.png" /><h4>4. Past and Future Charges</h4><p>Towards the bottom of the subscription details view you can see a log of all past payments and anticipated future payments, complete with payment amount and payment status.</p><p>If you ever have a patient with a failing payment, this is where you’ll want to take a look to gather more information about what’s going on and take action.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-11.png" /><h4>Toggle Filters</h4><p>You can click the Last Charge Failed toggle to filter your list to show all plans for which that is the case. These plans will be highlighted red.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-12.png" /><p>If you’d like the list to also Show Canceled Plans, there’s a toggle for that as well.</p><img alt="" src="/images/patient-subscriptions/patient-subscriptions-13.png" /><h4>Status Definitions</h4><p>Each subscription plan will have a status displayed under the ‘Status’ column.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Active</strong></p><p>Currently enabled, all payments to date processed as expected.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Canceled</strong></p><p>Manually canceled by a staff member, not reversible. A new subscription will need to be made if the patient would like to continue.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Expired</strong></p><p>The most recent payment failed, and then failed again in the following 24 hours. Time to update payment information. Often seen in conjunction with ‘Past Due’ status.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Incomplete</strong></p><p>The first payment attempt failed. A second attempt will run within 24 hours. If it fails again, the status will update to ‘Expired.’</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Past Due</strong></p><p>The scheduled payment failed and now the balance is outstanding. Often seen in conjunction with ‘Expired’ status.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Scheduled</strong></p><p>Upcoming payment</p></li></ul><h4>In Conclusion</h4><p>Subscriptions can be a powerful and predictable source of revenue for a practice.
