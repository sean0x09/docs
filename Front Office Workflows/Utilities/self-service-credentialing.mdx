title: "Self-service Credentialing"
---

#### Overview

The Self-Serve Credentialing Matrix is a centralized tool designed to simplify and standardize how providers and insurance companies manage credentialing requirements. It provides an at-a-glance reference for the credentialing status of each provider–payer relationship, ensuring clarity, compliance, and faster decision-making.

Credentialing is a critical process that validates whether providers meet the requirements of insurance companies to deliver care under their plans. Traditionally, this information is fragmented, requiring manual lookups and repeated back-and-forth. The self-serve credentialing matrix eliminates that friction by giving all stakeholders immediate visibility into credentialing statuses.

#### How would it help?

- **Efficiency** – Cuts down on time spent searching for or verifying credentialing requirements.
- **Transparency** – Provides providers and payers with a shared source of truth.
- **Scalability** – Supports onboarding, cross-coverage, and expanding provider networks with minimal administrative overhead.
