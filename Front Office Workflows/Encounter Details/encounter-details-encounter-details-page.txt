You can also access the complete Prior Authorizations working list for your practice, download a CSV of encounters based on the filters you’ve set, and create a new encounter from here.</p><p><br></p><h4>Editing an Existing Encounter</h4><p>Upon opening the Encounter Details page, you’ll see a list of all encounters.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-2.png"><p>When you click into an encounter, an editing window will appear.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-3.png"><p>You may click into any section and edit it, then review and submit/resubmit/forward or save. See the new encounter creation walkthrough below for more details.</p><p>If you simply want to view the information about the patient, insurance, providers, etc., you may of course do so and then simply click the <code>X</code> in the upper right corner to close the editing window.</p><p><em><strong>Once you manually edit an encounter, that encounter will no longer automatically receive updates from your EHR.</strong></em></p><p><br></p><h4>How to Bulk Edit Encounter Working Status</h4><p>You can select multiple encounters in the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/encounter-details">Encounter Details page</a> and update their <strong>working status</strong> (e.g. ‘Open,’ ‘In Progress,’ ‘Blocked,’ or ‘Not Intended to Bill’) in bulk.</p><p>Check out this quick video for a demonstration.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSx7PPqAa_M?iv_load_policy=3&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1" data-thumbnail="Medium Quality" frameborder="0" allow="presentation; fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h4><br></h4><h4>Walkthrough Encounter Creation and Section Information</h4><p>Let’s create a new encounter as an example case. Note that the same process would apply if you were editing an encounter, but many fields would already be filled in with existing information.</p><p>Click <code>Create Encounter</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-4.png"><p>A window will appear, inviting you to create a blank encounter or start from a template based on an existing patient’s previous encounter.</p><p>You can also choose to <code>Load from Filters</code>, which is an excellent way to automatically enter known basic information. For example, you could set filters for the patient, provider, and facility, then select <code>Load from Filters</code>. All of that information would populate in the appropriate fields.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yRwgbPcYWfM?iv_load_policy=3&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1" data-thumbnail="Medium Quality" frameborder="0" allow="presentation; fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p><strong>For this demonstration, we’ll click </strong><code><strong>Create Blank Encounter</strong></code><strong>.</strong></p><p>You can also create an encounter based on previous encounters. <em><strong>Use encounter templates based on a patient’s last encounter wisely and often!</strong> They greatly expedite data entry and reduce the possibility of human error.</em></p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-5.png"><p>An editing window will pop up with informational sections organized as shown below.</p><h3>Encounter Information</h3><h4>Patient</h4><p>This section allows you to use existing patient information, or to <code>Create Patient</code>. We’ll choose <code>Create Patient</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-6.png"><p>Next, we’ll fill in the patient’s basic information and click <code>Save</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-7.png"><p>Now we’ll see the new patient’s information populate the Patient section.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-8.png"><p>Click <code>Next Step</code> when everything looks correct.</p><p><br></p><h4>Insurance</h4><p>In the encounter’s Insurance section, you can add or update <strong>primary, secondary, and tertiary insurance information</strong>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-9.png"><p><em><strong>Notes on Insurances Listed in the Dropdown Menus</strong></em></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><em>The options that pre-populate these lists come directly from information that Athelas has extracted from your EHR.</em></p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><em>The initial list only shows insurances previously <strong>associated with this patient</strong>.</em></p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><em>If you click </em><code><em>Create Insurance</em></code><em> in one of the dropdown menus (primary, secondary, or tertiary), you can select from all known insurances associated with your practice. Fill in the new insurance information and click </em><code><em>Create Insurance</em></code><em>.

These indicators appear when the selected insurance requires a specific claim type and will receive the corresponding form.</p><p>In the example above, <em>UB</em> will receive a <strong>UB-04</strong> form, while <em>Blue Cross</em> will receive a <strong>CMS-1500</strong> form. See each insurance’s ‘Payer Type’ information noting which is which.</p><p><strong>Based on your selection of institutional and/or professional insurances, appropriate fields will be shown or hidden throughout the rest of these sections.</strong></p><p><em>What is the difference between professional and institutional claims?</em></p><p><em>The services billed on <strong>professional</strong> claims are tied directly to the individual healthcare provider's actions – consultations, surgeries, therapy sessions, etc. <strong>Institutional</strong> claims bill for the use of the facility– room stays, use of medical equipment, and so on.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>Providers</h4><p>Input the <strong>rendering</strong>, <strong>attending</strong>, <strong>referring</strong>, and <strong>supervising provider</strong> if applicable (these provider fields may change depending on whether a CMS-1500 and/or UB-40 forms will be filed for this encounter).</p><p>You can either visit the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/my-practice">My Practice page</a> to create new providers, or you can simply type a provider’s NPI number into the search field and their information will populate, as shown below. Note that we source this information directly from the NPI registry, but you can update this information if necessary.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-12.png"><p><br></p><h4>Facility</h4><p>Facility, Place of Service code, type of facility, type of care, and claim frequency code may all be entered here. Type of bill is automatically determined by the information you input in these optional fields.</p><p>Admission and discharge data should be entered here as well.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-13.png"><p>To add a new facility, go to the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/my-practice">My Practice page</a>.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: You can set a default Place of Service (POS) code option for each of your facilities from the My Practice page, either upon creation or when you edit them, shown below.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-14.png"><p>Click <code>Next Step</code>.</p><p><br></p><h4>Service Lines</h4><p>This section allows you to add or update dates of service, templates (detailed below), ICD-10 codes, and service lines.</p><p>The claim charge amount is automatically calculated as a sum of all service line charges.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-15.png"><p>Encounters for which a UB-40 form is required will display the <strong>Revenue Code</strong> column in the table of service lines, as shown in the example above. Those codes come from directly from guidelines set by your practice or EHR.</p><p>For example, if your practice is a FQHC, then Wraparound Claims are billed with revenue code 0519.</p><p>If revenue code errors are detected upon review of the encounter, Insights will prompt you to update any known and suggested codes with one click, as shown below.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4WwdvUiPws?iv_load_policy=3&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1" data-thumbnail="Medium Quality" frameborder="0" allow="presentation; fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p><em>Contact our support team at </em><a href="mailto:support@getathelas.com"><em>support@getathelas.com</em></a><em> for help with mapping revenue codes.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>Templates</h4><p>Access service line templates here.

We recommend also deleting the old one to avoid confusion.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-18.png"><p><strong>If you’d like to create a service line template, you’ll need to first fill out all service lines in the next section.</strong></p><p>Your new template will then be created based on those service lines and you’ll be prompted to give it a name before clicking <code>Confirm</code>.</p><p><br></p><h4>Diagnosis Codes</h4><p>Start typing to find the diagnosis code you want to add, then click to select it.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-19.png"><p><em><strong>You can also search using colloquialisms</strong> to find the code you need.</em></p><p><em>For example, you could type ‘ACL’ and then select from a list of codes pertaining to anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</em></p><p>When one of the payers entered on the&nbsp;<code>Insurances</code>&nbsp;page has a preferred billing type of UB-04, then you will be able to differentiate between Admitting, Principal, and other relevant diagnoses in this section.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-20.png"><p><br></p><h4>Service Lines</h4><p>When you click <code>Add Service Line</code>, a window will appear.</p><p>Fill in the details of the service line here, including procedure code, diagnosis code pointers, modifiers, and so forth (UB-40 encounters will also show a field for revenue code).</p><p>You can also check the box to indicate if the procedure was performed as an emergency (which will update section 24c on the CMS-1500 form).</p><p>Once everything looks correct, click <code>Create Service Line</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-21.png"><p><strong>Notes About Service Lines</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Procedures from your practice’s self-pay fee schedule will appear here only if the visit/DoS was self-pay</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Charges for CPT codes that auto-populate are based on insurance information and your practice’s fee schedule, but you can overwrite them if necessary. &lt;/aside&gt;</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Claim Information</strong></p><p>You have the option to add data on occurrences (if an insurance requiring a UB-40 claim has been selected in the Insurances section), illness date, and any additional claim information in this section.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-22.png"><p>For <strong>Workers’ Comp or automobile billing type</strong> encounters, a date of injury field will also appear here.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Authorizations</strong></p><p>This is where you can add any prior authorizations.</p><p>For this example, we’ll click <code>Add Authorization</code>. This will bring up a window in which we can create and edit either a pre-certified authorization or a referral.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-23.png"><p>Note that you can switch between viewing the list of Pre-Certifications and Referrals by clicking the corresponding button in the top left corner.</p><p>For this example, we’ll create a pre-certified authorization.</p><p>Click <code>Add Authorization</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-24.png"><p>A new window will appear. Fill in the information and click <code>Create</code>.</p><p>Indicate whether this is a pre-certification or a referral. Then fill in all required fields and click <code>Create</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-25.png"><p><em>Rather than only tracking prior auth by visit count, you can choose to track it either by visit count or by a particular CPT code and a unit count, if applicable.</em></p><p>You’ll see your new prior authorization in the previous window, where it has been automatically selected. Click <code>Save</code>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-26.png"><p><em>Note that if a referral is specified as a prior authorization, you will be unable to edit the referring provider in the following Providers section.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>Supporting Documentation</h4><img alt="" src="/images/encounter-details-page/encounter-details-page-27.png"><p>Upload any supporting documentation here.</p><p>Note that previously submitted documentation for this encounter is neither visible nor downloadable here.
