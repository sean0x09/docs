### At a Glance

Prior authorization must be present in many circumstances in order for insurers to pay out claims. This guide details where to enter and update this information in Insights.

#### What Is Prior Authorization?

**Before providing treatment or prescribing medication, physicians need to obtain approval from an insurer**. This tactic, used by insurance companies to control costs, is called prior authorization. Without prior authorization, a health plan may not pay for treatment or medication.

Emergency care doesn't need prior authorization.

### Here is the [Prior Authorizations page](https://insights.athelas.com/prior-authorizations).

You can access it via the header of the list of encounters on the [Encounter Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/encounter-details). Click the ‘Prior Authorizations’ button.

Fill in the patient name, authorization type (pre-certification or referral), auth number, and effective and expiration dates.

You can choose to track prior auth by visit count or CPT code unit count. For this example, we’ll select visit count.
