**Notes on Insurances Listed in the Dropdown Menus**

- The options that pre-populate these lists come directly from information that Athelas has extracted from your EHR.
- The initial list only shows insurances previously **associated with this patient**.
- If you click `Create Insurance` in one of the dropdown menus (primary, secondary, or tertiary), you can select from all known insurances associated with your practice.

- Fill in the new insurance information and click `Create Insurance`. This will now be a selectable option in the Insurance menus for this patient.
*If you need a new insurance to appear here, please contact our account management team.*

**Notes on Professional vs. Institutional Insurances**

Note the **CMS-1500** and **UB-04** indicators in the header. These indicators appear when the selected insurance requires a specific claim type and will receive the corresponding form.

In the example above, *UB* will receive a **UB-04** form, while *Blue* will receive a **CMS-1500** form. See each insurance’s ‘Payer Type’ information noting which is which.

**Based on your selection of institutional and/or professional insurances, appropriate fields will be shown or hidden throughout the rest of these sections.**

*What is the difference between professional and institutional claims?*

*The services billed on **professional** claims are tied directly to the individual healthcare provider's actions – consultations, surgeries, therapy sessions, etc. **Institutional** claims bill for the use of the facility– room stays, use of medical equipment, and so on.*

Once the insurance information is updated, click `Begin Review`.

- **If there are presubmission errors or suggested edits**Sometimes you’ll see errors that prevent you from closing out the encounter. For many of these, quick fixes to incorrect data are possible (a missing CPT code, incorrect facility information, etc.)Use the `Jump to Section` button to get straight to the page with the issue.

If there are no errors or suggested edits, select the closing option that best suits your needs (`Resubmit to Primary`, `Forward to Secondary`, etc.)
