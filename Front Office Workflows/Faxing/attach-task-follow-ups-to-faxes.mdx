title: "Attach Task Follow-ups to Faxes"
---

Now you can attach task follow-ups directly to incoming or outgoing faxes. This makes it simple to keep track of next steps—right from your fax list

#### What is it?

A new **Manage Tasks** button appears on the right of each fax. Clicking it brings up a table of tasks associated with that fax.

All task drawers are pre-filled with the fax number (and patient, when available) so you don’t have to re-enter context.

#### FAQ's

**Can I link the same task to both a patient and a fax?**

- Yes, if a fax is already linked to a patient, creating a task for it links it to the patient automatically. That means you can access it the patient’s task page as well. You can modify this behavior by adding or removing patients from the Create Task form.
**Can I add a fax to a task from the **[Tasks page](http://insights.athelas.com/tasks)**?**

- No, currently we do not support adding a fax to a task from the Tasks page. You will have to create it from the Faxing page. You can, however, view and manage tasks linked to faxes from the Tasks page.
