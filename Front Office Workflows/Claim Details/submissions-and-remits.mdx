### At a Glance

As your practice’s list of claims and remits can quickly grow to many thousands of entries long, it is helpful to know how to quickly find claims and remits by date posted.

### Here’s How to Do It

On the [Claim Details](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/claim_level_view) page, open the Filters. You’ll see the four filters that this guide will cover: ‘**Submission before,’ ‘Submission after,’ ‘Remittance before,’ and ‘Remittance after.’**

For the purposes of this guide, we’ll walk through the ‘Submission before’ filter. **The process is the same for all of these filters.**

Click on ‘Submission before’ and then pick a date.

Now, you’ll see all claims submitted before your chosen date, beginning with the submission closest to that date.

If instead we filtered by ‘Submission after,’ the list would begin with the most recent submission.
