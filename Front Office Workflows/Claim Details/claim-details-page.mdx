The [Claim Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view) will likely be one of your practice’s most utilized pages in Insights. It provides essential information about each encounter at a glance, with all details of a given encounter readily available within a click or two.

This overview will cover the information you can find on the Claim Details page.

## Main Page

**How to Filter Results to Speed Up Your Search**

As your practice will likely have several thousand claims listed here, the many filters available will drastically decrease the time you spend sorting through them manually.

Please **take a moment to familiarize yourself with these filters**. Knowing which sorting options are available to you will save a lot of headaches down the road.

You can also always simply start typing in the Search bar to find what you’re looking for.

<img src="/images/Front%20Office%20Workflows/Claim%20Details/claim-details-page/claim-details-page-3.png" alt="" />

For example, this list has been filtered to show only claims with an Encounter Status of ‘Approved.’

**Viewing Denials from the Claim Details page**

Because many people also use the [Claims Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view) to analyze denials, there’s a filter to let you see any denials visible in the Denials Worklist:

<img src="/images/Front%20Office%20Workflows/Claim%20Details/claim-details-page/claim-details-page-5.png" alt="" />

<img src="/images/Front%20Office%20Workflows/Claim%20Details/claim-details-page/claim-details-page-6.png" alt="" />

**This is slightly different from filtering to the Encounter Status of Denied**, which includes denials that have been worked and omits partial and secondary denials.

There is an explanatory alert to help clarify the distinction between the two:
