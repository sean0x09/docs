### At a Glance

<img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/kqAEri5lS1Cyqp24TMxholNDSM.png" alt="" />

The [Claim Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view) will likely be one of your practice’s most utilized pages in Insights. It provides essential information about each encounter at a glance, with all details of a given encounter readily available within a click or two.

This overview will cover the information you can find on the Claim Details page.

## Main Page

**How to Filter Results to Speed Up Your Search**

As your practice will likely have several thousand claims listed here, the many filters available will drastically decrease the time you spend sorting through them manually.

Please **take a moment to familiarize yourself with these filters**. Knowing which sorting options are available to you will save a lot of headaches down the road.

You can also always simply start typing in the Search bar to find what you’re looking for.

For example, this list has been filtered to show only claims with an Encounter Status of ‘Approved.’

**Viewing Denials from the Claim Details page**

Because many people also use the [Claims Details page](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view) to analyze denials, there’s a filter to let you see any denials visible in the Denials Worklist:

<img src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/wyrisxmxD91oZlhtrZm6QVQ8VhQ.png" alt="" />

**This is slightly different from filtering to the Encounter Status of Denied**, which includes denials that have been worked and omits partial and secondary denials.

There is an explanatory alert to help clarify the distinction between the two:
