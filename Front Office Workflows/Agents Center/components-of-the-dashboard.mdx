#### Session Analytics

The Session Analytics window allows you to view important metrics at a glance. It provides general information and context so that you can prioritize and focus attention on any potential issues.

Filter for the time period to view at the top, and the four boxes will calculate and display:

- Total sessions
- Success rate
- Appointments scheduled
- Estimated dollars saved
Click through the carousel and hover your cursor over each graph to see further details about:

- Sessions over time

- Inbound, outbound, and total number

- Session status breakdown

- How many calls are completed, in progress, or need action

- Event types over time

- How many calls were made to create appointments, add patients, etc.

- Sentiment distribution

- Positive, neutral, or negative

### Agents Manager

With the Agents Manager, you can:

- View all agents
- Configure new outbound agents for specific tasks
- Connect new agents into the existing network for reusability
- Customize agent behavior and scripts
The Agents Manager allows you to track the flow of conversations with callers through each agent, beginning with the Default Agent in the green box on the left.

In the below example, the Default agent can answer the inbound call and then transfers it seamlessly to the Identity Verification Agent (that determines who the caller is based on phone number). That Agent can then seamlessly transform into a New Patient Appointment Agent, or an Existing Appointment Agent etc.

In creating agents, you can provide standalone instructions and give it access to special tools. In this case, the New Patient Agent has clear instructions ("Ask for the insurance plan etc."), and has the ability to look up appointments, and get more context on the patient.

You can also create new **outbound** agents and connect them to the existing inbound nodes.

Some example use cases for creating new outbound agents include:

- Patient pre-visit screens
- Post-visit follow-ups and check-ins
- Patient outreach for new campaigns
- Sending one-off calls to patients on a waitlist

#### History

The History section of the Agents Center stores information about all current and past calls made through the system.

Use the filter at the top of this section to expedite your search for a specific patient, session type, created date range, etc.
