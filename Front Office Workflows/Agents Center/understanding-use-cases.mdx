#### 1. Inbound Call Handling

With the Agents Center, your practice can:

- Schedule new appointments for both new and existing patients
- Reschedule existing appointments
- Collect patient information including first name, last name, date of birth, insurance details, and member ID
- Document reason for visit
- Send appointment confirmation forms via text
- Triage patient needs, leave messages, and escalate to humans when necessary
Here is an example demo call:

#### 2. Call Tracking and Management

During calls, the system provides near real-time updates including:

- Different agents involved in each call
- Actions taken during the call (creating, scheduling, cancelling, escalating)
- Direct links to resources created (patient demographics, appointment page, showing appointment changes over time with user: Agent)
After each call, the system:

- Creates detailed call logs with transcripts (using the same model as Scribe with 99.4% accuracy)
- Marks calls as "completed" when successfully handled
- Flags calls that require human intervention as "needs action"

#### 4. Configuration

This is where you’ll set the appointment types that can be scheduled, log provider scheduling preferences and availability, set insurance acceptance preferences, and set your call escalation number to a human-monitored line..

#### Best Practices

- Use the analytics to identify peak call times and adjust staffing accordingly
- Regularly review calls marked as "needs action" to address complex patient inquiries
- Customize your agent scripts to match your practice's specific protocols and terminology
- Start with a limited scope of agent capabilities and expand as you become more comfortable with the system
