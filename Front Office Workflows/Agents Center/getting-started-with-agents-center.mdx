The [Agents Center page](https://insights.athelas.com/agents-center) is a powerful AI-driven call system designed to streamline administrative tasks and enhance patient communication for healthcare providers.

#### Overview

In Air, our Agent has access to all of the following data:

- The entire practice scheduling preferences
- Patient demographic and clinical history
- Insurance eligibility and past claim history
Due to direct, in-built integration into Air, our agents are able to answer the following questions:

- What meds did the doctor last prescribe for me again? [CHART NOTE HISTORY]
- Can you tell me how much I owe in my last bill? Why did I get charged that much? [BILLING HISTORY]
- When is Dr. Bill going on vacation? Can you get me a slot before he goes out? [PROVIDER SCHEDULING PREFERENCES]
More broadly, our Agents Center enables your practice to:

- Answer questions about the patient
- Set provider scheduling preferences
- Build and manage outbound agents
- Send one-off outbound calls or campaigns
- Configure appointment types
- Monitor all call activity and view analytics/performance
