title: "Make an Outbound Call"
---

Use this feature to make or schedule a one-off outbound call to a patient. The benefits of doing so here, rather than making a standard phone call, are as follows:

- An automated agent will make the call, saving you time
- The conversation and sentiment will be tracked and logged automatically for future reference
- The call can be scheduled for your convenience
- Updates to appointment timing, insurance, appointment reason, etc. can all be handled by AI so that the right information gets into your schedule
- Send one-off outbound calls to specific patients
- Create and manage outbound call campaigns
- Track the status and results of outbound communications
- Contact new or existing patients
- Define additional context for calls to assist agents in completing tasks
