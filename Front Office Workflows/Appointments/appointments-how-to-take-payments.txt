<h3>At a Glance</h3><p>Sometimes you’ll need to show patients (or non-patients) a breakdown of what they’ve paid, either for that day, or for a date of service two years ago because their lawyer requested it.</p><p>Here’s how to find receipts for those payments and the options at your disposal for receipt distribution in Insights.</p><p><em>Please note that while you can manually download, print, and send receipts via text or email on all current and past transactions, <strong>you will not be able to automatically send receipts via text or email for past transactions</strong>.</em></p><p><br></p><h3>Here’s How to Do It</h3><h4>Take Payment and Create a Receipt for a Patient</h4><p>You can access patient payment records in a number of ways on Insights.
