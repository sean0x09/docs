### At a Glance

Sometimes you’ll need to show patients (or non-patients) a breakdown of what they’ve paid, either for that day, or for a date of service two years ago because their lawyer requested it.

Here’s how to find receipts for those payments and the options at your disposal for receipt distribution in Insights.

*Please note that while you can manually download, print, and send receipts via text or email on all current and past transactions, **you will not be able to automatically send receipts via text or email for past transactions**.*

### Here’s How to Do It

#### Take Payment and Create a Receipt for a Patient

You can access patient payment records in a number of ways on Insights. For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll simply go through the [Patient Responsibility page](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/patient-responsibility), though the process is essentially the same from the Appointments page or the patient profile.

First, choose a patient with an outstanding balance and click ‘Pay Balance.’

Next, fill out the amount the patient would like to pay towards their outstanding balance. You can apply credits if applicable, and if the patient wants to do so.

If the account has a guarantor, they will be listed in the 'Pay As' dropdown as well as the patient.

Then, choose the method of payment. For this example, we’ll say the patient is paying $20 in cash toward their overall balance. Click ‘Confirm.’

*Note that partial payments towards outstanding balance will be applied to the largest individual charge first.*

You now have the option to ‘Send,’ ‘Download,’ or ‘Print’ a receipt.

For this example, we’ll download the receipt. The PDF is shown below.

#### Receipts for Previous Patient Payments (from the Patient’s Profile)

Go to the profile of the patient in question.

Under the ‘Charges’ tab, find the row for the date of service for which you would like a receipt and click `View Details`.

*You can filter by Date of Service and/or Provider to narrow down your search if necessary. You can also try searching only Paid charges.*

Next, you’ll have the option to Download or Print the receipt.

In this example, we’ll download the receipt. The PDF we get looks like this:

Done! Now, you can email this receipt as an attachment to the patient, payer, or whoever needs it.

#### Take a Payment and Find Receipts for Quick Purchase Customers (i.e. Non-Patient Payments)

On the [Appointments page](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/appointments), select `+ Quick Purchase`.

<img src="/images/Front%20Office%20Workflows/Appointments/how-to-take-payments/how-to-take-payments-8.png" alt="" />

In the window that appears, select the `Sell to non patient` box and fill in the customer’s information. For this example, the customer will pay in cash.

Once you `Confirm` the purchase, you will have the opportunity to print or send a receipt to the purchaser.

The payment will show up in the `Quick Customer View` on the [Patient Responsibility page](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/patient-responsibility) with all the other non-patient transactions.

In the Action column, you can Download Receipt, Print Receipt, or Refund Payment.

Done!
