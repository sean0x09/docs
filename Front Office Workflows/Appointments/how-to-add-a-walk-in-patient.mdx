A popup will let you choose either Existing Patient or New Patient. If it’s an existing patient, simply select them from the drop-down menu and ensure their information is up to date.

If it's a new patient, enter all their information. There’s a toggle at the bottom of the form to acknowledge accuracy and consistency with your EHR, so **be sure to update your EHR as well**.
