When it comes to understanding your calendar, what you’re really trying to do is get a good sense of what your day looks like in an instance’s glance, and this is exactly how it should be. The less time you need to decipher your calendar, the more time you can spend assisting patients along their healthcare journey.

Navigate to the Calendar in the left Nav Bar
