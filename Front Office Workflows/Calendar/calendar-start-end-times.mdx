<h4>Customizing start &amp; end times</h4><p>To modify the start and end times, head to <em>Preferences → Calendar → Start &amp; End Times</em>. Here you can select the starting time and an the ending time.</p><h4>Default start &amp; end times</h4><p>By default, the calendar start and end times are set to display 06:00am to 08:00pm and this is applied at a site level (meaning all facilities adopt the same times). You can choose to set one site-wide start &amp; end time or set specific times for specific facilities.</p><img alt="" src="/images/calendar-start-end-times/calendar-start-end-times-1.png" /><h4>Applying unique start &amp; end times to various facilities</h4><p>If you wish to specify unique start &amp; end times to specific facilities, select the “Facility” option and a table should appear below.</p><p>On this table, selecting any facility will make its start &amp; end time controls appear on the right.
