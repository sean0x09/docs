If you’d like to navigate to a specific day, click on the filter icon. A side panel will pop open upon doing so. A mini calendar is available to you to traverse more quickly through the days to a specific date in mind. Here is also where you can update the providers and facilities seen on your calendar view. Additionally, you are able to filter by insurance and patient from and hide cancelled or no show appointments and weekends.

The calendar on Air provides 7 filtering options:

| Filter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| By provider | Multi-select |
| By Facility | Multi-select |
| By Insurance | Multi-select |
| By Patient | Multi-select |
| Hide Cancelations | Yes/No |
| Hide No Shows | Yes/No |
| Hide Weekends | Yes/No |

#### How to use each filter

**Filtering by provider **allows you decide which providers you do and don’t want to see on your calendar. When more than once provider is selected, each provider is displayed as a column on the calendar view.

**Filtering by facility **allows you to pick facilities you do and don’t want to see in the calendar view. When more than one facility is selected, each will appear as a tab along the top of the calendar view.

**Filtering by Insurance **shows only appointments with patients whose insurance provider matches your selection.

**Filtering by Patient** shows only appointment with specific patients you select.

**Filtering out cancelations** will hide appointments that have the “Cancelled” status.

**Filtering out “No Shows”** will hide all appointments that have the “No Show” status.

**Filtering out weekends** will hide Saturdays and Sundays from your calendar view. This will be applied to all of the 1 day, week, and month views.

All filters can be cleared at once by clicking the “Clear All” at the top of the calendar.
