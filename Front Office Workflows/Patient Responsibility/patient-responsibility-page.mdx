### At a Glance

The [Patient Responsibility page](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/patient-responsibility) on Insights details all the information you need to assess, track down and collect outstanding PR balances.

There’s a lot of information on this page, so this guide sticks to the basics. Relevant guides with more information are linked as appropriate.

## Overview

#### Analysis

At the top of the Patient Responsibility page, you can click to expand or collapse the Analysis window.

Here you can view, at a glance, the total patient collections, total outstanding PR, the number of patients with outstanding balance, and the amount paid from the most recent statement batch reminder.

The two bar graphs display Age of Balance and Patient Total Balance, respectively. They can be toggled to show either the dollar amount or the number of patients.

You can also click ‘Download CSV’ on either of these graphs to analyze the data in a spreadsheet.

### Tabs Available

### Patient View

The Patient View tab shows a list of all patients, when they were last contacted, their current balance, and any unapplied credits they may have.

Click on any of these headings to sort the list in ascending or descending order of that heading.

If you’d like to see those with outstanding balance only, outstanding credits only, and/or held PR only, you can toggle these options on or off under the ‘Filter’ section.

Use the filters for Patient, DOB/Phone/Name, Age of Balance, or Patient Total Balance to aid your search. In this example, we’ll search by Patient.

Now, we can see only this patient’s information in the list.

From here, we can either have the patient pay their balance or click into their profile and see further details about their account, such as an itemized list of charges.
