#### At a Glance

Customers can pay for all kinds of things via credit card in Insights. Saving cards will save hassle of entering information over and over. On the other hand, you’ll always need a way to remove cards that have expired or that customers have requested be removed.

This guide explains how to set up Insights to save (or not save) credit cards by default, and how to manually toggle saved cards on or off on a case-by-case basis. It also covers how to add a card to a patient’s profile without charging them, how to remove a saved card, and how to manually enter card information without a card reader.

Open your practice’s [PR Settings](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/patient-responsibility-settings).

Under the ‘General’ tab, find the ‘Card Fees’ section. Here, you can set the default for your site by toggling `Auto-Save patient credit cards` on or off.
