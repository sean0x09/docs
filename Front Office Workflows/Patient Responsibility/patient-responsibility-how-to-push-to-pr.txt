Here are two good options.</p><h4>From a Claim in Claim Details, Denials Worklist, or Rejections</h4><p>Click into a claim on the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v3/claim_level_view">Claim Details page</a> (or <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v3/denials">Denials Worklist</a> or <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/rejections">Rejections</a>), then open the ‘Actions’ menu in the top right corner and select <code>Push to PR</code>.</p><p>Note that this option will only be available if a balance exists that can be pushed to PR.</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-push-to-pr/how-to-push-to-pr-1.png"><p>You’ll see each charge listed with its Current PR, as well as an adjustable field for the Final PR Amount.</p><p>You also have the option to ‘<strong>Keep current insurance</strong>’ or ‘<strong>Switch to self-pay</strong>.’</p><img alt="" src="/images/how-to-push-to-pr/how-to-push-to-pr-2.png"><p>Switch to Self-Pay is a good option when the payer will definitely not pay, for example if the claim was denied and not being appealed, or a patient has reached their benefit maximum.</p><p>Make adjustments if necessary. Then, you can check or uncheck the box to ‘Automatically Write Off Remaining Balances.’</p><p>Finally, write a reason for the push to PR, then click <code>Confirm Push to PR</code>.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>With the Posting Tool</h4><p>This walkthrough illustrates an efficient method using the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/posting-tool">Posting Tool page</a>.</p><p>Navigate to the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/posting-tool">Posting Tool</a> and filter for the encounter in question.</p><p>Click the arrow next to the encounter to see all its procedures.
