#### Pre Visit

This section allows you to set up defaults for the information you’d like to see and share prior to each appointment.

- Set which pre-visit payment suggestions you’d like to see, including deductible and coinsurance. The copay suggestion is required.
- Set pre-visit suggested payments mode. In other words, choose how you would like Athelas to translate eligibility results into pre-visit payment recommendations: show only the highest PR amount, or show all relevant PR amounts.
- Set up default charges by facility for copay, coinsurance, deductible, and self-pay.
- In the pre-visit payment suggestions section, you can choose whether to ignore, add, or only show tier 2 and 3 benefits.
- Set any default STCs you would like to apply to appointments in the Service Type Codes section.
- Choose whether to send a welcome message by default after the patient pays in this section. Note that this function is available in several places across Insights, and updating this setting in one location will update it in all other locations.

#### Credits

Here, you can set the number of days to elapse before patient credits are automatically released for general use.

Credits resulting from patient overpayment are held in reserve by default, in case the claim is resubmitted in the future. Please specify the number of days you would like to wait after a claim is Approved before any associated credits are released to cover outstanding balances.
