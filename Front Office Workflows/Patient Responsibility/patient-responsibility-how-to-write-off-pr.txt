How to Write Off PR


<p><strong>Clarification: Write-off vs. Cancellation</strong> This guide describes how to write off patient responsibility, which is a distinct concept from cancelling PR. Here’s the difference:</p><p><strong>Write Off PR</strong>: This is your practice determining that — while PR may technically be due — your practice is not going to collect it. For example a patient who is unable to pay, and it’s not worth your staff’s time to pursue the bad debt. All PR can be written off.</p><p><strong>Cancel PR</strong>: This is your practice saying that the PR is incorrect, that it should never have existed in the first place, and for that reason you are erasing it. There are some restrictions on what types of PR can be cancelled. To learn about those, please read the help guide: <a href="https://www.notion.so/How-to-Cancel-Patient-Responsibility-f4e3cabad8b144ff80ad702e6343a1be?pvs=21">How to cancel patient responsibility</a>.</p><h4>Here's How to Do It</h4><p>Navigate to the patient's profile.
