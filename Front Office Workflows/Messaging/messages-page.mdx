### At a Glance

Need to just send a quick message to a colleague or have a conversation better suited to an instant messaging system than an email thread? Head over to the [Messages page](https://insights.athelas.com/messages)! This feature enables staff to interact with each other, all within Insights itself. Up to ten staff can be added to a thread.

### Here’s How it Works

To begin a thread with one or more colleagues, navigate to the Messages page and click the pencil icon to create a new conversation.

A search bar will appear. Search for the colleague in question and select their name when it appears.

Now, you can write out a message and/or add attachments, as shown below.

### Received Messages

When there are new messages for you, notifications will appear in two places.

As a red dot 🔴 on the notification center (🔔 icon) in the header of any page in Insights.
