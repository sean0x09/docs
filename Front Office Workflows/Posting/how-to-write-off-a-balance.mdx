### Write Off PR (Procedure Only Action)

**⚠️ Currently, Write Offs can only be applied to procedure-level Payment Items.**

A **Patient Responsibility Write Off** removes a balance that was assigned to the patient but should no longer be collected. This is typically used when your organization decides not to bill the patient for a portion of their responsibility (copay, deductible, or coinsurance).

Like payer write offs, this is a **net-zero operation**: the amount is moved out of the corresponding **Patient Responsibility** column and into the **Other Adjustments** column. This reduces the **outstanding patient balance** on the encounter by the written-off amount.

**How it works:**

- Locate the remittance with a patient responsibility balance (copay, deductible, or coinsurance) you want to write off in the **Payment Items Table**.
- Open the **Actions** menu (three-dot menu in the right-most column) and select **Write Off PR**.

- Enter a reason for the write off **and specify the amount to write off for each PR CARC**. Then click **Write Off PR.**

- Review the preview. Crossed-out values with updated values beside them will show how the write off affects encounter-level and (if applicable) procedure-level amounts. Click the **undo** button (in the right-most column) to remove this preview.

**Notes:**

- Write Off PR can only be applied to **patient responsibility balances** like **coinsurance, deductible, or copay** (not to payments).
- The original amounts remain visible in the ledger for auditing, with the write off recorded as a separate line item.
- In the **preview row**, you can click directly on the **Value columns** or the **Note column** to edit amounts or text before posting.
