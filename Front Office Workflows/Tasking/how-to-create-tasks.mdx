On the tasks page, you will see two tabs — one for tasks assigned *to *you (My Tasks), and one for tasks assigned *by* you.

For this demonstration, we’ll create a new task.

First, click `+ Task`.

In the popup, entitled ‘Create Task,’ enter a title and a clear, detailed description for the task.

When you choose the ‘Assignee,’ the menu will automatically populate with the names of your colleagues with Insights accounts. Begin typing to narrow results to find the staff member you want, then click their name to select them.

Set the priority level, status, and due date for the task, if applicable.

When you set a task type, you can either select one of the existing options or you can create a new task type. To create a new task type, simply type in the box and then select `+ CREATE`, as shown below.

You can also upload a file related to the task. Note that larger files will take longer to upload.

Once the task creation modal is filled out to your specifications, click `Create`.

Additionally, you can associate a task to a specific patient or group of patients. You can see each patient’s related tasks on their patient profile.
