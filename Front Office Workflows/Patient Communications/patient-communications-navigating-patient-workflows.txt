Navigating Patient Workflows


<h4>Overview</h4><p>The new Patient Flow page was carefully designed to improve visibility while setting up workflow configurations.</p><p>Users will be able to preview patients that will be texted every time they make a change to a workflow, preventing accidental edits that cause the config to not message as expected.</p><p>This document aims to highlight the key improvements made, and how to better use them. The new page can be found under <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/patient-workflows">https://insights.athelas.com/patient-workflows</a></p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-1.png"><h4>Usage</h4><h4>Creating a New Automated Intake Workflow</h4><p>Using the workflows page, you are able to customize exactly which appointments get sent specific intake forms and even configure the message and time when they’re sent out. At the top of the page, you’re able to name your workflow and then configure the specifications which the intake forms and appointment reminders will be sent out.</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-2.png"><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-3.png"><p>These specifications include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Appointment Types</strong>: Specify which appointment types are sent this workflow</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Appointment Reasons</strong>: Specify the appointment reasons that apply to this workflow</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Patients</strong>: Specify which patients will receive this workflow</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>This feature is useful when testing out workflows, as you can create a test patient and set it to only be sent to that individual</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Specify which facilities will receive this workflow</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Providers</strong>: Specify which providers the patient must be scheduled with to receive this workflow</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Appointment Insurances</strong>: Specify which insurances a patient must tie to an appointment to receive this workflow</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Minimum Age</strong>: Specifies a minimum age a patient must be in order to receive this workflow</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Maximum Age</strong>: Specifies a maximum age a patient cannot surpass in order to receive this workflow</p></li></ul><p>The option to send out intake forms immediately upon the creation of an appointment matching the workflow’s specifications is also available. Simply check the box next to <em>Send Immediately on Appointment Creation</em>. Additionally, there are two methods that the workflow can be sent by: email and/or text.</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-4.png"><p>Regardless of the method of delivery, you the message contents will show up the same for both. This message can be configured to your liking. Scroll over the “i” icon next to message templates for additional coding that will populate unique information based off the specifications indicated within the workflow. For instance, inputting {patient_name} will show the patient’s name in the text/email sent out.</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-5.png"><p>If you’re ever unsure that your message is populating correctly for the patient, there is a message preview available. This is found at the bottom of Message Template. You are also encouraged to send this workflow to a test patient beforehand just to ensure that no errors are made.</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-6.png"><p>Appointment reminders can also be configured to be sent 3 separate times to a patient (not including immediately upon appointment creation). Here, you’ll be able to customize the amount of days and hours you’d like to send the reminder before the appointment.</p><blockquote><p>❗<strong>Note</strong>: Appointment reminders are queued to be sent out at midnight each day. If you create an appointment for a patient that is scheduled for tomorrow- they will not receive a reminder if the message is only scheduled to be sent 1 day before. However, they will be able to receive the reminder if its set to an hour before.</p></blockquote><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-7.png"><p>Lastly, at the very bottom you will be able to select the intake forms you’d like to send to the patient. You are able to select as many or as little forms as you’d like by clicking on the checkbox to the left of the intake form. To bulk select all templates, select the checkbox at the very top next to <em>Template Name</em>.</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-8.png"><h4>Editing an existing workflow</h4><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-9.png"><p>Now, when editing an existing workflow, before any <strong>changes are saved</strong>, a preview modal will pop up showing <strong>all patients that will receive communication</strong> if that edit is confirmed.</p><p>This brings a whole new level of visibility into the impact of workflows when users are creating/editing them</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-10.png"><p>We also show <code>Appointment Type</code>and <code>Facility</code>, since these are the most common fields users use to specify their configs</p><h4>Visualizing impact of workflow</h4><h4>Main table</h4><p>On the main table, users are able to see per workflow how many messages are going still going out in that day and how many were already sent. That allows them to check at a glance if something is wrong with their configs.</p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-patient-workflows/navigating-patient-workflows-11.png"><p>You can also click on the bubbles and they will show you an exact breakdown!
