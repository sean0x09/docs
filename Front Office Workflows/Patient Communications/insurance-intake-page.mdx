#### Core Feature Walkthrough

#### Insurance Intake Flow

- A patient’s insurance receives a coverage-related denial.
- That patient receives a post-visit text to update their insurance information in the patient portal.
- They log in into their patient portal and get redirected to the Insurance Confirmation Form.
- The Insurance Confirmation Form consists of three instances of the form below: one for each of primary, secondary, and tertiary insurance.

For each instance, there are three options that can be chosen:

- **Current Insurance**: Writes back the current appointment insurance into the form
- **New Insurance**: A blank form, patient adds new insurance information to be updated in the appointment
- **No Insurance**: Patient chooses to self-pay for the appointment

- Patient fills in their information and submits
- Eligibility check is run on the primary insurance
- Insurance Update flow concludes
