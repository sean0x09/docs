# Working with Claims

The Claims Page is where you manage your entire claim workflow—from initial review to final submission. This page helps you process more claims per day with fewer errors by providing powerful filtering, AI-powered validation, and team collaboration tools all in one place.

**What you'll accomplish here:**

- Find and prioritize claims that need your attention
- Review and correct claim information before submission
- Catch errors automatically before they become rejections
- Assign work across your team to balance workload
- Track claim status from submission through payment

**Key benefits of using Athelas RCM:**

- **Fewer rejections:** AI validation catches errors before submission, reducing rework
- **Faster processing:** Custom views and bulk actions help you work through claims efficiently
- **Better visibility:** See exactly what changed, why, and who worked on each claim
- **Zero claims left behind:** Assignment tracking ensures every claim has an owner

<Info>
The Claims Page replaces manual sorting and checking with intelligent automation. Most billers report processing 30-40% more claims per day after switching to the new workflow.
</Info>

## Setting Up Your Workspace

Before you start processing claims, set up custom views that match how you work. Think of views as personalized workspaces—each one shows you exactly the claims you need to focus on for a specific task.

### Why custom views matter

Without views, you'd manually filter hundreds or thousands of claims every time you want to work on a specific subset. Views save your filter combinations and display preferences so you can access them instantly whenever you need them.

**Example workflows:**

- A "High Priority" view showing claims over $1,000 that needs submission
- A "Ready to Submit" view showing approved claims assigned to you
- A "Denials This Week" view showing recently denied claims that need attention

### Creating your first filtered view

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with a clear goal">
    Decide what type of work you're setting up this view for. Are you focusing on high-value claims? Claims from a specific insurance provider? Denials that need review?

- **Example goal:** "I want to see all unassigned claims from Blue Cross Blue Shield worth over $500"

</Step>
  <Step title="Apply filters">
    Click the **Filter** button at the top of the Claims Page. You'll see dozens of filter options including:

- **Encounter Status:** Draft, Ready for Review, Approved, Submitted, Paid, Denied
- **Insurance Provider:** Filter by specific payers
- **Claim Amount:** Set minimum/maximum dollar amounts
- **Age:** How long the claim has been in the system
- **Assignment:** Assigned to you, assigned to others, or unassigned
- **Date ranges:** Creation date, submission date, payment date

Select the filters that match your goal. You can combine multiple filters—for example, filter by both insurance provider AND claim amount AND assignment status.

<Tip>
Start with 2-3 key filters. You can always add more later as you refine your workflow.
</Tip>

</Step>
  <Step title="Customize your display">
    Choose which columns you want to see by clicking the **Columns** button. Display only the information relevant to your current task.

**Common column combinations:**

- For submission work: Patient Name, DOS, Provider, Claim Amount, Status, Assigned To
- For denial review: Patient Name, Payer, Denial Reason, Denial Date, Amount
- For high-dollar claims: Patient Name, Claim Amount, Payer, Age, Status

You can also sort by any column by clicking the column header.

</Step>
  <Step title="Save your view">
    Once your filters and display look right, click **Save View** in the top right corner.

Give your view a descriptive name that clearly indicates its purpose:

- ✅ "BCBS High Value - Unassigned"
- ✅ "My Ready to Submit"
- ✅ "This Week's Denials"
- ❌ "View 1" (not descriptive enough)

<Check>
**Verify it worked:** Your saved view should now appear in the Views dropdown menu at the top of the page. Your filters and column settings will persist across all your sessions.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Recommended views to create

Set up these four views to cover your most common workflows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="My Active Work" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Filters:** Assigned to you + Status is "Ready for Review" or "Approved"

**Use when:** Starting your daily work to see what's on your plate

</Card>
  <Card title="Unassigned Priority" icon="inbox">
    **Filters:** Unassigned + Claim Amount >$500 + Age <7 days

**Use when:** Picking up new work or balancing team workload

</Card>
  <Card title="Ready to Submit" icon="paper-plane">
    **Filters:** Assigned to you + Status is "Approved" + No blocking errors

**Use when:** You're ready to submit a batch of claims

</Card>
  <Card title="Recent Denials" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Filters:** Status is "Denied" + Denial Date within last 7 days

**Use when:** Working through denials that need correction and resubmission

</Card>
</CardGroup>
<Info>
Your views are personal—they won't affect what your teammates see. Each team member can create views that match their specific responsibilities.
</Info>

### Switching between views

Access your saved views anytime using the **Views tab** at the top of the Claims Page. Click a view name to instantly apply all its filters and display settings.

**Pro tip:** Most billers keep their "My Active Work" view open as their default, then switch to specialized views when handling denials, picking up unassigned work, or submitting batches.

## Daily Claim Management Workflow

This section walks you through the complete workflow for processing claims—from finding work to final submission.

### Finding claims to work

Your goal is to identify which claims need your attention right now. The Claims Page starts with all claims visible, which can be overwhelming. Use your saved views and filters to focus on what matters.

### Strategy 1: Start with your assigned work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your 'My Active Work' view">
    Select your saved "My Active Work" view from the Views dropdown. This shows all claims assigned to you that are ready for review or approved.

You should see a manageable list of claims—typically 20-50 items depending on your team's workflow.

</Step>
  <Step title="Prioritize by claim value or age">
    Click the **Claim Amount** column header to sort by dollar value (highest first), or click the **Age** column to sort by how long claims have been waiting.

**General priority order:**

1. High-value claims ($1,000+) that are nearing submission deadlines
2. Claims from your practice's top payers
3. Older claims (10+ days) to prevent them from aging out
4. Remaining claims by submission deadline

</Step>
  <Step title="Begin working from the top">
    Click the first claim in your prioritized list to open the encounter details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Strategy 2: Pick up unassigned work

If you've completed your assigned claims or your team needs to balance workload, switch to finding unassigned claims.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your 'Unassigned Priority' view">
    This view shows unassigned claims that meet your priority criteria (typically high-value or time-sensitive).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the list for claims you can handle">
    Look for claims that match your expertise or the providers/specialties you typically work with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign claims to yourself">
    You'll learn how to assign claims in the next section. For now, identify 5-10 claims you want to work on.
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
Can't find the claims you're looking for? Use the **Search bar** to search by patient name, claim ID, or provider name. This is fastest when you know exactly which claim you need.
</Tip>

### Understanding claim statuses

As you review your filtered claims, you'll see various statuses. Here's what each means and what action you should take:

| Status | Meaning | Your Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Draft** | Claim information is incomplete | Complete missing fields before review |
| **Ready for Review** | Claim is complete and waiting for biller review | Review for accuracy, check for AI-flagged errors |
| **Approved** | Claim has been reviewed and is ready to submit | Verify one final time, then submit |
| **Submitted** | Claim has been sent to the payer | Monitor for acceptance or rejection |
| **Paid** | Payment received from payer | Reconcile payment, close claim |
| **Denied** | Payer rejected the claim | Review denial reason, correct and resubmit |

<Check>
**Quick check:** You should now be able to open a filtered view, sort by your priority criteria, and identify 5-10 claims to work on. If you can't, review the "Setting Up Your Workspace" section above.
</Check>

---

### Assigning claims

Assignment ensures every claim has an owner and prevents duplicate work. You should assign claims whenever you're about to work on them or when distributing work across your team.

### When to assign claims

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Before you start working" icon="user-check">
    Assign a claim to yourself before you begin reviewing it. This signals to your team that you're handling it and prevents someone else from working on the same claim simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When distributing workload" icon="users">
    If you're a team lead or helping balance work, assign claims to specific team members based on their expertise, workload, or the types of claims they typically handle.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Never leave claims unassigned for long" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Your goal is to keep fewer than 1% of open claims unassigned. Unassigned claims can fall through the cracks, age out, or result in duplicate work.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Assigning individual claims

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the claim">
    From your Claims Page list, find the claim you want to assign. You don't need to open the encounter details—you can assign directly from the list view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the assignment dropdown">
    In the **Assigned To** column, click the dropdown for that claim. You'll see a list of all team members who can work claims.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the assignee">
    Click the team member's name. To assign to yourself, select your own name.

The claim is now assigned. You'll see the assignee's name appear in the **Assigned To** column immediately.

<Check>
**Verify:** The claim should now appear in that person's "My Active Work" view (or your own if you assigned it to yourself).
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
If a claim is already assigned to someone else but you need to take it over, simply assign it to yourself. The system will update the assignment and log the change in the claim's Change History.
</Tip>

### Bulk assigning multiple claims

When you need to assign many claims at once—for example, distributing 50 new claims across a team of 5 billers—use bulk assignment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter to the claims you want to assign">
    Use filters to narrow down to exactly the claims you want to assign. For example, filter to show only unassigned claims from a specific payer.

<Warning>
Be careful with your filters. Whatever claims are currently visible will be affected by your bulk action.
</Warning>

</Step>
  <Step title="Select claims for bulk assignment">
    **Option A:** Check the box next to each claim you want to assign.

**Option B:** Click the checkbox in the table header to select all visible claims at once.

You'll see a count of selected claims appear at the top of the page (e.g., "15 claims selected").

</Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Bulk Actions' button">
    With claims selected, click the **Bulk Actions** button that appears at the top of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose 'Assign'">
    From the bulk actions menu, select **Assign**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the assignee">
    Choose the team member who should receive all selected claims. All selected claims will be assigned to this single person.

<Info>
If you need to distribute claims across multiple people, repeat this process for each person with different filtered subsets of claims.
</Info>

</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the assignment">
    Review the confirmation message showing how many claims will be assigned and to whom. Click **Confirm**.

<Check>
**Verify:** The **Assigned To** column should now show the assignee's name for all the claims you selected. The selected count should reset to zero.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

**Best practices for bulk assignment:**

- Distribute high-value claims evenly across experienced billers
- Assign claims from familiar providers to billers who know those workflows
- Balance workload by checking each team member's current assigned claim count before adding more
- Use the "Age" column to ensure old claims get assigned first

<Warning>
Bulk assignment cannot be undone with a single action. If you make a mistake, you'll need to reassign claims individually or use another bulk assignment to fix it. Always double-check your filters before confirming a bulk action.
</Warning>

---

### Reviewing individual claims

Once you've identified a claim to work on and assigned it to yourself, open the encounter details to begin your review. Your goal is to verify all information is correct, fix any errors, and ensure the claim is ready for submission.

### Opening encounter details

Click any claim in your list to open the full encounter details page. This page shows all information about the claim, organized into tabs:

- **Content:** Patient demographics, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and charges
- **Payment Overview:** Payment status broken down by payer and procedure
- **Submissions:** History of submission attempts and applied rules
- **Patients:** Communication history with the patient about payment responsibility
- **Remittances:** Electronic remittance advice (ERA) documents from payers
- **Claim Timeline:** Visual timeline of all events related to this claim
- **Change History:** Audit log of all modifications made to the claim

You'll spend most of your time on the **Content** tab during review.

### Understanding AI validation and error flags

As you review a claim, the system automatically validates it and flags potential issues. This is one of your most powerful tools for catching errors before submission.

<Card title="What the sparkles (✨) mean" icon="sparkles">
Sparkles appear next to fields where AI has improved the claim to maximize reimbursement or ensure compliance.

**Common AI improvements:**

- Corrected zip codes based on patient address
- Added appropriate modifiers to procedure codes
- Updated place of service codes for accuracy
- Suggested diagnosis codes that better support the procedures

**What you should do:** Click the sparkle to see what changed and why. Review the AI's logic to ensure it makes sense for this specific case. You can accept or reject the change.
</Card>

<Card title="What error flags (⚠️) mean" icon="triangle-exclamation">
Red or yellow flags appear next to fields that have problems that must be fixed before submission.

**Common errors flagged:**

- Missing required fields (patient DOB, insurance member ID)
- Invalid diagnosis codes or procedure codes
- Conflicting information (e.g., date of service is in the future)
- Missing or invalid provider NPI numbers

**What you should do:** Fix the flagged field immediately. The claim cannot be submitted until all error flags are resolved.
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with error flags">
    Scan the Content tab for any red or yellow warning icons. These indicate problems that will prevent submission or cause rejections.

Click each flag to see the specific error message and what needs to be corrected.

</Step>
  <Step title="Fix flagged errors">
    Update the incorrect or missing information directly in the encounter details. Common fixes:

- **Missing patient information:** Add DOB, address, or insurance details from your practice management system
- **Invalid codes:** Correct ICD-10 diagnosis codes or CPT procedure codes
- **Provider issues:** Verify and update provider NPI numbers or credentials

As you fix each error, the flag should disappear automatically.

<Check>
**Verify:** All error flags should be resolved before moving to the next step. If flags remain, the system will block submission.
</Check>

</Step>
  <Step title="Review AI improvements (sparkles)">
    Look for sparkle icons (✨) indicating AI-suggested changes. Click each one to review:

- **What changed:** The original value vs. the AI-suggested value
- **Why it changed:** The reasoning behind the improvement
- **Impact:** How this change affects reimbursement or claim success

**Decision points:**

- If the AI change makes sense for this patient and encounter, accept it
- If the change seems incorrect or doesn't apply, reject it and keep the original value
- When unsure, ask the AI copilot (covered in next section) or consult with your team lead

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify core claim information">
    Even without flags or sparkles, double-check these critical fields:

- Patient demographics match your practice management system
- Date of service is correct
- Provider and facility information is accurate
- Diagnosis codes support the procedures billed
- Procedure codes match the services actually provided
- Units and charges are correct

<Tip>
Keep your practice management system open in another tab for easy verification.
</Tip>

</Step>
  <Step title="Preview changes before submission">
    Click the **Preview** button at the top of the encounter details. Choose your preferred format:

- **Standard view:** Shows the claim in the same format as the Content tab
- **PDF view:** Shows exactly what the payer will receive (CMS-1500 or UB-04 format)

Review the preview carefully. This is your last chance to catch errors before the claim goes out.

**What to check in preview:**

- All AI changes appear correctly
- No missing fields or obvious errors
- Charges and units calculate correctly
- Provider and facility information displays properly

</Step>
  <Step title="Check for blocking rules">
    Before you can submit, the system runs final validation checks:

- **CHC verification:** Ensures Community Health Center compliance if applicable
- **Internal blocking rules:** Catches issues your organization has configured to prevent (e.g., claims missing certain documentation)

If a blocking rule triggers, you'll see a clear error message explaining what needs to be fixed. The **Submit** button will be disabled until you resolve the issue.

<Warning>
Blocking rules exist to protect you from submitting claims that will definitely be rejected. Don't try to work around them—fix the underlying issue instead.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Using the AI copilot for questions

If you're unsure about a field, coding decision, or whether a claim is ready, ask the AI copilot directly from the encounter details page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the copilot">
    Click the **AI Copilot** button (usually in the bottom right corner of the encounter details page). A chat interface will appear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask specific questions">
    The copilot understands the context of the claim you're viewing. You can ask:

- `"Why did the AI suggest adding modifier 25 to this procedure?"
"Is diagnosis code M54.5 appropriate for this encounter?"
"What's the most common reason this payer denies claims for this procedure?"
"Should I bill 99214 or 99213 for this visit?"
Be specific with your questions to get the most helpful answers.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Review the copilot's response">
    The copilot will provide an explanation with reasoning. It may reference:
    - Coding guidelines
    - Payer-specific rules
    - Historical data about similar claims
    - Best practices for this situation

`Use this information to make your decision, but remember you're ultimately responsible for the claim's accuracy.`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Info>
The AI copilot is trained on coding guidelines, payer rules, and your organization's historical data. It's especially helpful for complex coding scenarios or when learning new specialties.
</Info>

### When the claim is ready

Once all errors are fixed, AI changes are reviewed, and you've verified accuracy:

1. The encounter status should automatically update to **Approved**
2. No error flags should be visible
3. The **Submit** button should be enabled (not grayed out)

You're now ready to submit—but don't submit just yet. Continue to the next section to learn about collaborating with your team and the final submission process.

<Check>
**Self-check:** Before moving on, confirm you can:
- Identify and fix error flags in a claim
- Review and accept/reject AI improvements (sparkles)
- Use the preview feature to see the final claim
- Ask the AI copilot questions about a claim

If you can't do these tasks, review this section again.
</Check>

### Collaborating with your team

Some claims require input from multiple people—whether you need clarification from a provider, help from a coding specialist, or approval from a supervisor. Use the activity feed and comments to coordinate without switching tools.

### Viewing team activity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Activity Feed">
    While viewing an encounter's details, look for the **Activity** section (usually in the right sidebar or as a tab).

The activity feed shows all recent actions on this claim in chronological order.

</Step>
  <Step title="Review what happened">
    You'll see entries like:
    - "Sarah assigned this claim to John" (timestamp)
    - "John updated procedure code from 99213 to 99214" (timestamp)
    - "AI suggested adding modifier 25" (timestamp)
    - "Sarah submitted claim to Blue Cross Blue Shield" (timestamp)

This gives you complete visibility into who did what and when.

</Step>
  <Step title="Identify when you need to act">
    Look for patterns that indicate you need to do something:
    - Multiple people editing the same fields (potential confusion)
    - A claim reassigned to you with recent changes (review what changed before proceeding)
    - Comments directed at you (covered in next section)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding comments for your team

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Comment'">
    In the Activity Feed section, look for an **Add Comment** or **Comment** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your comment">
    Be specific about what you need or what you want your teammates to know:

✅ **Good comments:**

- "@Dr.Smith: This procedure code looks unusual for this diagnosis. Can you confirm this is correct?"
- "@TeamLead: This claim has been denied 3 times. Should we escalate to the payer rep?"
- "Corrected patient DOB from 01/15/1985 to 01/15/1995 per chart review"

❌ **Vague comments:**

- "Looks wrong"
- "Help"
- "Check this"

<Tip>
Use @mentions to notify specific team members. They'll receive a notification that they need to review your comment.
</Tip>

</Step>
  <Step title="Submit your comment">
    Click **Post** or **Submit**. Your comment appears in the activity feed immediately with your name and timestamp.

<Check>
**Verify:** Your comment should be visible in the activity feed. If you @mentioned someone, they should receive a notification.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Responding to comments

When someone leaves a comment on a claim assigned to you or mentions you directly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the comment in context">
    Read the comment carefully and check the claim details being referenced. Look at what fields were changed recently to understand the context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take appropriate action">
    - If it's a question, investigate and respond with your findings
    - If someone identified an error, fix it and confirm you've corrected it
    - If you need more information, ask follow-up questions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reply in the activity feed">
    Add your own comment explaining what you did or what you found. This creates a clear record of the resolution.

Example: "Fixed - updated procedure code to 99214 as Dr. Smith confirmed. Ready for submission."

</Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
Don't use comments for urgent issues. If a claim needs immediate attention or there's a time-sensitive problem, reach out to your team directly via Slack, email, or in person, then document the resolution in the activity feed.
</Warning>

---

### Submitting claims with confidence

You've reviewed the claim, fixed errors, verified accuracy, and confirmed it's ready. Now it's time to submit to the payer.

### Pre-submission checklist

Before clicking Submit, run through this quick checklist:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All error flags resolved" icon="circle-check">
    No red or yellow warning icons should be visible. If you see any flags, resolve them first—the system won't let you submit anyway.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI changes reviewed" icon="sparkles">
    You've clicked each sparkle, reviewed the AI's reasoning, and either accepted or rejected the suggestion based on your professional judgment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Core information verified" icon="clipboard-check">
    Patient demographics, provider information, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and charges are all correct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview looks correct" icon="eye">
    You've previewed the claim (preferably in PDF format) and it matches what should be sent to the payer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No blocking rules triggered" icon="shield-halved">
    The system hasn't flagged any CHC compliance issues or internal blocking rules. The Submit button should be enabled.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Understanding applied rules

Before submission, the system automatically applies billing rules that optimize your claim based on payer requirements and billing best practices.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check applied rules">
    On the **Submissions** tab (or in the submission preview), look for a button labeled **"X rules applied"** where X is the number of rules that ran.

Click this button to see the full list.

</Step>
  <Step title="Review what each rule does">
    The rules list shows:
    - **Rule name:** What the rule is designed to do
    - **What changed:** Specific modifications made to your claim
    - **Why it matters:** How this improves the claim's chance of acceptance or reimbursement

Common rules you'll see:

- **Modifier addition:** Adds appropriate modifiers for multiple procedures, assistant surgeons, etc.
- **Unit correction:** Adjusts units billed based on procedure type and medical necessity
- **Place of service:** Updates POS codes to match the encounter type
- **Bundling prevention:** Unbundles procedures that can be billed separately

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify rules make sense">
    Most rules should make sense for the specific claim. If a rule seems wrong:

1. Click the rule to see detailed reasoning
2. Consult with a senior biller or team lead if unsure
3. If the rule is genuinely incorrect, you may need to override it (your organization's policies determine if you can do this)

<Warning>
Don't override rules casually. They're designed to maximize reimbursement and reduce rejections based on data from thousands of claims.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Submitting the claim

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Submit button">
    With everything verified, click the **Submit** button at the top of the encounter details page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm submission">
    A confirmation dialog appears showing:
    - Which payer the claim is going to
    - The total claim amount
    - How many procedures are included

Review this information one last time, then click **Confirm Submission**.

</Step>
  <Step title="Wait for confirmation">
    The system sends your claim to the payer and shows a success message. You should see:
    - "Claim successfully submitted to [Payer Name]"
    - Updated encounter status: **Submitted**
    - A new entry in the Submissions tab with submission date and time

<Check>
**Verify submission:** Go to the **Submissions** tab and confirm you see a new submission record with today's date. The encounter status should be **Submitted**.
</Check>

</Step>
  <Step title="Move to the next claim">
    Return to your Claims Page list view. The claim you just submitted should either:
    - Disappear from your current view (if you're filtering for non-submitted claims)
    - Update its status to **Submitted**

Select the next claim in your queue and repeat the review and submission process.

</Step>
</Steps>

### What happens after submission

Once submitted, the claim moves into a monitoring phase:

1. **Payer acknowledgment** (1-3 business days): The payer confirms they received the claim
2. **Processing** (14-30 days typically): The payer reviews and processes the claim
3. **Payment or denial** (30-45 days typically): You receive either payment or a denial with reason

You'll monitor these claims using your **Submitted** claims view and respond to any denials or requests for additional information.

### Batch submission tips

If you're submitting multiple similar claims (e.g., 20 claims from the same provider for the same procedure), use these strategies to work faster:

<Card title="Use your 'Ready to Submit' view" icon="layer-group">
Filter to show only approved claims with no errors. Review and submit them one after another without switching between views.

**Time saved:** Reduces context switching and maintains focus
</Card>

<Card title="Open multiple claims in new tabs" icon="window-restore">
Right-click claims in your list and open them in new browser tabs. Review all tabs quickly, then submit each one in sequence.

**Time saved:** Eliminates waiting for pages to load between claims
</Card>

<Card title="Process by payer" icon="building-columns">
Group your submissions by insurance company. Submit all BCBS claims together, then all Aetna claims, etc. This helps you remember payer-specific requirements.

**Time saved:** You maintain mental context about each payer's quirks
</Card>

<Info>
Most experienced billers submit 50-80 claims per day using these workflows. As you get comfortable with the process, you'll develop your own rhythm and efficiency tricks.
</Info>

## Analyzing Claim Performance

Once claims are submitted, your work shifts to monitoring outcomes, analyzing denials, and tracking payments. This section helps you identify patterns, resolve issues, and ensure your practice gets paid correctly.

---

### Working with denials

Denials happen—even with careful review and AI validation. Your goal is to identify why claims were denied, fix the issues, and resubmit quickly to minimize revenue delays.

### Finding and filtering denials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Denials view">
    Switch to your saved "Recent Denials" view, or create a new filter:
    - **Encounter Status:** Denied
    - **Denial Date:** Within last 7-30 days (depending on your workflow)

`This shows all denied claims that need your attention.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Sort by priority">
    Sort your denials to focus on the most important ones first:

- **By claim amount (highest first):** Tackle high-dollar denials that impact revenue most
- **By denial date (oldest first):** Prevent claims from hitting timely filing limits
- **By payer:** Group denials by insurance company to spot patterns in payer-specific requirements

</Step>
  <Step title="Review denial reasons">
    The **Denial Reason** column shows why each claim was rejected. Common denial reasons include:

- **Missing or invalid information:** Incorrect patient ID, provider NPI, or authorization number
- **Coding errors:** Invalid diagnosis or procedure code combinations
- **Medical necessity:** Payer determined the service wasn't medically necessary
- **Duplicate claim:** Payer believes they already paid this claim
- **Timely filing:** Claim was submitted past the payer's deadline
- **Authorization required:** Service needed pre-authorization that wasn't obtained

<Tip>
If you see the same denial reason across multiple claims from the same payer, this indicates a systemic issue—not just individual claim problems. Flag these patterns to your team lead.
</Tip>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Analyzing individual denials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the denied claim">
    Click the claim to view full encounter details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the denial details">
    Go to the **Payment Overview** tab. Expand the payer section to see:

- **Denial code:** The specific code the payer used (e.g., CO-16, CO-97)
- **Denial reason:** Plain language explanation
- **Denied amount:** How much was denied
- **Remark codes:** Additional context from the payer

Read the full denial explanation carefully. Sometimes the stated reason isn't the actual problem—you need to read between the lines.

</Step>
  <Step title="Check the Remittances tab">
    Click the **Remittances** tab to view the full ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) from the payer.

The ERA often contains additional details not visible in the Payment Overview. Look for:

- Secondary denial reasons
- Specific fields the payer flagged as problematic
- Instructions for correcting and resubmitting

Download the ERA if you need to share it with your team or appeal the denial.

</Step>
  <Step title="Review the Claim Timeline">
    Switch to the **Claim Timeline** tab to see the full history:

- When was the claim originally submitted?
- How long did the payer take to process it?
- Were there any previous submission attempts?
- Did anyone from your team review this claim before the denial?

This context helps you understand if the denial was:

- An error you could have caught
- A payer mistake (happens more often than you'd think)
- The result of incomplete information from your practice

</Step>
  <Step title="Use the AI copilot for denial analysis">
    Ask the AI copilot specific questions about the denial:

- "Why was this claim denied for medical necessity?"
- "What's the correct way to code this service for Blue Cross?"
- "How do I appeal a denial for CO-16?"
- "Is this a correctable error or should I write this off?"

The copilot can provide guidance on common denial reasons and suggest corrective actions.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Correcting and resubmitting denials

Once you understand why the claim was denied, fix the issue and resubmit.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make necessary corrections">
    Based on the denial reason, update the claim:

**For missing information denials:**

- Add the missing patient demographics, insurance details, or authorization numbers
- Verify all required fields are complete

**For coding errors:**

- Correct invalid diagnosis or procedure codes
- Add or modify modifiers as required by the payer
- Ensure diagnosis codes support the procedures billed

**For duplicate claim denials:**

- Check if the payer actually paid this claim previously
- If yes, close the claim as paid
- If no, add a note explaining this is not a duplicate and resubmit

**For timely filing denials:**

- Document the date of original submission if you submitted on time
- Include proof of timely filing in your resubmission notes
- If truly late, check if your state allows appeals for extenuating circumstances

**For authorization denials:**

- Obtain the required authorization retroactively if your payer allows it
- If not possible, this may need to be written off or billed to the patient

</Step>
  <Step title="Document your corrections">
    Add a comment in the Activity Feed explaining:
    - What was denied and why
    - What you corrected
    - Why you believe this will resolve the denial

`Example: "Denied for missing member ID. Added correct member ID from patient insurance card on file. Verified with payer eligibility - member is active. Resubmitting."

This creates an audit trail and helps teammates learn from similar denials.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Resubmit the claim">
    Follow the same submission process from Section 3.5:
    - Verify all corrections were saved
    - Preview the corrected claim
    - Review applied rules
    - Click Submit

<Check>
**Verify:** The Submissions tab should now show two submissions—the original denied submission and your new corrected submission with today's date.
</Check>

</Step>
  <Step title="Monitor the resubmission">
    Set a reminder to check this claim's status in 14-30 days. If it's denied again:
    - Review the new denial reason (it may be different)
    - Consider whether this requires an appeal rather than another correction
    - Consult with your team lead on escalation
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
**Timely filing deadlines are strict.** Most payers give you 60-90 days from date of service to submit claims. If a claim is denied and you're approaching the deadline, prioritize correcting and resubmitting it immediately—even before processing other claims.
</Warning>

### Identifying denial patterns

<Steps>
  <Step title="Group denials by reason">
    Use your Denials view and sort by **Denial Reason**. Look for:

- `5+ claims with the same denial code from the same payer
Repeated denials on claims from a specific provider
Common errors in a particular procedure type`

</Step>
  <Step title="Investigate the root cause">
    When you spot a pattern, dig deeper:

- Is your practice missing required authorization for certain procedures?
- Is a provider using outdated diagnosis codes?
- Did a payer change their requirements recently?
- Are you missing required information in your intake process?

</Step>
  <Step title="Report to your team lead">
    Document the pattern and share it with your team lead or billing manager:

"I've identified 8 denials from Aetna this week, all for procedure code 99214 with denial code CO-16 (missing claim information). All are missing authorization numbers. We should add authorization verification to the intake checklist for this payer."

Systemic issues require process changes, not just individual claim corrections.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Tracking payments

After claims are submitted and accepted by payers, you need to track payments to ensure your practice receives correct reimbursement.

### Understanding the Payment Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a paid or partially paid claim">
    Find a claim with **Encounter Status** of "Paid" or "Partially Paid" and click to open it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Payment Overview tab">
    This tab shows payment details organized two ways:

**By Payer:**

- Primary insurance paid amount
- Secondary insurance paid amount (if applicable)
- Patient responsibility amount

**By Procedure:**

- Each procedure code billed
- Amount billed vs. amount paid for each
- Adjustments or denials for each procedure

</Step>
  <Step title="Check if the claim is balanced">
    A claim is **balanced** when: Billed Amount = (Paid Amount + Patient Responsibility + Adjustments)

The Payment Overview shows balance status:

- ✅ **Balanced:** Everything adds up correctly, claim is complete
- ⚠️ **Unbalanced:** There's a discrepancy that needs investigation

<Info>
Most claims should balance automatically if the payer's ERA was processed correctly. Unbalanced claims usually indicate missing payment information or posting errors.
</Info>

</Step>
  <Step title="Expand payer and procedure sections">
    Click the expand arrow (▶) next to each payer or procedure to see detailed breakdowns:

- **Allowed amount:** What the payer's contract allows for this service
- **Paid amount:** What the payer actually paid
- **Patient responsibility:** What the patient owes (copay, coinsurance, deductible)
- **Adjustment codes:** Why amounts were adjusted (contractual obligation, bundling, etc.)
- **Remark codes:** Additional context from the payer

This detail helps you verify payments are correct according to your contract.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Verifying payment accuracy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compare paid amount to expected amount">
    Check if the payer paid according to your contract:

- Is the allowed amount consistent with your fee schedule?
- Are contractual adjustments appropriate?
- Did they pay for all procedures or deny some?

<Tip>
Keep a reference sheet of your contracted rates with major payers. This makes verification faster.
</Tip>

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify patient responsibility calculation">
    Ensure patient responsibility is calculated correctly:

- **Copay:** Fixed amount (e.g., $25) should match patient's plan
- **Coinsurance:** Percentage of allowed amount (e.g., 20% of $100 = $20)
- **Deductible:** Patient pays full allowed amount until deductible is met

If patient responsibility seems wrong:

- Check the patient's eligibility details (available in the Eligibility section)
- Verify deductible status with the payer
- Correct the patient balance before sending PR collections

</Step>
  <Step title="Investigate unexpected adjustments">
    If a procedure was adjusted down more than expected:

- Read the adjustment codes and remark codes in the Payment Overview
- Common legitimate adjustments: bundling, multiple procedure reduction, sequestration
- Questionable adjustments: "reduced to the contracted rate" when you believe you're billing at the contracted rate

If an adjustment seems incorrect, document it and discuss with your team lead about appealing.

</Step>
  <Step title="Review the Remittances tab">
    Download and review the full ERA for complete payment details. The ERA is your official record of payment and is needed if you need to appeal underpayments.
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
**Never assume a payment is correct just because it arrived.** Payers make mistakes. A quick 30-second verification can identify underpayments worth hundreds of dollars that can be recovered through appeals.
</Warning>

### Using the Patients tab for PR collection

Patient Responsibility (PR) collection is critical to your practice's revenue. The Patients tab helps you track collection efforts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Patients tab">
    From any encounter with patient responsibility, click the **Patients** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review communication history">
    You'll see all text messages and emails sent to this patient about this specific claim:

- `Date and time of each communication
Type (SMS, email)
Content of the message
Patient response (if any)
Payment result (paid, no response, payment plan requested, etc.)
This shows you the complete patient collection journey.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate collection effectiveness">
    Look for patterns:

- **High response rate:** Patients respond to texts quickly → SMS is effective for this demographic
- **Low payment rate:** Many responses but few payments → Your payment links may be confusing, or amounts may be too high for patients to pay at once
- **No responses:** Patients ignoring communications → May need phone follow-up or may have incorrect contact information

Use these insights to adjust your collection strategy.

</Step>
  <Step title="Take action based on patient responses">
    If a patient responded but hasn't paid:
    - Offer a payment plan if your practice allows it
    - Verify the patient has the correct payment amount and link
    - Check if the patient is eligible for financial assistance

If a patient hasn't responded after 2-3 attempts:

- Verify contact information is current
- Consider phone outreach
- Flag for collections agency if past your practice's threshold

</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
**Best practice:** Review the Patients tab for high-dollar patient responsibility claims ($500+) at least weekly. These significantly impact your practice's revenue and deserve personal follow-up beyond automated messages.
</Tip>

---

### Monitoring claim history

Understanding what happened to a claim over time helps you catch delays, investigate issues, and maintain quality control.

### Using the Claim Timeline

The Claim Timeline provides a visual representation of every event in a claim's life.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Claim Timeline tab">
    From any encounter, click the **Claim Timeline** tab.

You'll see a vertical timeline with entries showing:

- Event type (submission, payment, status change, etc.)
- Date and time
- Who performed the action (system, specific user, or payer)
- Brief description of what happened

</Step>
  <Step title="Identify time gaps">
    Look for unusually long periods between events:

- **Creation to first review:** Should be <3 days typically
- **Approved to submission:** Should be <1 day typically
- **Submission to payer acknowledgment:** Should be <3 business days
- **Submission to payment:** Usually 14-45 days depending on payer

Long gaps indicate bottlenecks or claims that fell through the cracks.

<Warning>
If a claim has been "Submitted" for 60+ days with no payment or denial, it may be lost in the payer's system. Follow up directly with the payer to verify receipt and status.
</Warning>

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify proper sequence of events">
    Events should follow a logical order:

1. Claim created
2. Claim reviewed/edited
3. Claim approved
4. Claim submitted
5. Payer acknowledgment received
6. Payment or denial received
7. Claim balanced and closed

If events are out of order (e.g., submitted before approved), investigate what happened and whether it indicates a process problem.

</Step>
  <Step title="Use timeline for status verification">
    When a provider or patient asks "what's the status of this claim?", use the timeline to give a precise answer:

"We submitted this claim to Blue Cross on December 15th. They acknowledged receipt on December 18th. It's currently in processing and should be paid within the next 2-3 weeks based on their typical turnaround time."

This is more helpful than just saying "it's submitted."

</Step>
</Steps>

### Using the Change History

The Change History tab creates an audit trail of every modification made to a claim.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Change History tab">
    Click the **Change History** tab to see a chronological log of all updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review what changed">
    Each entry shows:
    - **Date and time** of the change
    - **Who made the change** (specific user or system/AI)
    - **Which fields were modified**
    - **Old value → New value** for each modified field

Example entry:

    `January 5, 2026 at 2:34 PM - Sarah Johnson
    Modified fields:
    • Diagnosis Code 1: M54.50 → M54.5
    • Procedure Modifier: [blank] → 25
    • Claim Amount: $150.00 → $175.00`

</Step>
  <Step title="Toggle to show all imports">
    By default, Change History hides imports with no changes. Click **Show all imports** to see every time the claim was imported from your practice management system, even if no data changed.

This is useful for:

- Verifying regular synchronization between systems
- Investigating why expected updates didn't appear
- Understanding timing of data flow

</Step>
  <Step title="Investigate unexpected changes">
    If a claim has problems, review the Change History to identify:

- `Who made the last change before an error appeared
Whether the system/AI made automatic changes that caused issues
If data was overwritten by an import from your PM system
Example: "This claim was denied for an incorrect provider NPI. The Change History shows the NPI was correct when we submitted it, but an import from the PM system overwrote it with the wrong NPI 2 hours after submission."`

</Step>
  <Step title="Click 'View' for detailed change information">
    Click the **View** button next to any change entry to see complete details:

- `Full context of what was changed
Reason for the change (if documented)
Related changes made at the same time
This is helpful for complex updates affecting multiple fields.`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Info>
The Change History is your source of truth for "who changed what and when." Use it liberally when investigating claim issues, training new team members, or responding to audits.
</Info>

### Checking patient eligibility

Before working on a claim—especially high-value claims—verify the patient's insurance eligibility to avoid wasting time on claims that will be denied for coverage issues.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Eligibility section">
    While viewing encounter details, scroll to the **Eligibility** section (often in the right sidebar or under patient information).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review eligibility status">
    You'll see:
    - **Coverage status:** Active, Inactive, Unknown
    - **Plan type:** PPO, HMO, EPO, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.
    - **Coverage dates:** Start and end date of current coverage
    - **Copay amounts:** Patient's copay for different service types
    - **Deductible:** Annual deductible and amount met to date
    - **Out-of-pocket maximum:** Annual maximum and amount met to date

<Warning>
**Inactive coverage** means the patient's insurance was not active on the date of service. These claims will likely be denied. Verify with the patient if they have other insurance or if there's a coverage gap.
</Warning>

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify eligibility is current">
    Check when eligibility was last verified:
    - **Verified today or within last week:** Data is current and reliable
    - **Verified >30 days ago:** Consider re-verifying, especially for high-dollar claims
    - **Never verified or "Unknown":** Click **Verify Eligibility** to run a real-time check with the payer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use eligibility data to prevent denials">
    Before submitting, confirm:
    - Coverage was active on the date of service
    - The service type is covered under the patient's plan
    - Prior authorization requirements are met (if shown in eligibility data)
    - The rendering provider is in-network (if eligibility shows network status)

`If anything looks wrong, investigate before submitting.`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Add a quick eligibility check to your review workflow for all claims over $500. This 10-second check can prevent hours of rework from coverage-related denials.
</Tip>

## Understanding AI Features

AI powers many of the claims page features that catch errors, improve accuracy, and maximize reimbursement. This section explains how AI works behind the scenes and how to interpret its recommendations.

---

### What the sparkles (✨) mean

Sparkles indicate that AI has automatically improved your claim. Understanding what triggers sparkles and how to evaluate AI changes helps you work confidently with AI assistance.

### Types of AI improvements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code corrections" icon="code">
    AI identifies and corrects:
    - Invalid or outdated diagnosis codes
    - Procedure codes that don't match the documented service
    - Missing or incorrect modifiers that affect reimbursement

- `*Example:** Patient chart shows "lower back pain" but diagnosis code is M54.50 (low back pain, unspecified). AI changes to M54.5 which is the current valid ICD-10 code, maximizing specificity.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Demographic corrections" icon="user">
    AI fixes common demographic errors:
    - Zip codes that don't match the city/state
    - Phone numbers with incorrect formatting
    - Address abbreviations standardized to USPS format

- `*Example:** Patient address shows "New York, NY 10005" but zip code field shows "90210." AI corrects zip to "10001" based on the New York City address.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Modifier additions" icon="plus">
    AI adds modifiers that increase reimbursement or ensure proper payment:
    - Modifier 25 for significant, separately identifiable E/M services
    - Modifier 59 for distinct procedural services
    - Modifier GT/95 for telehealth services
    - Anatomical modifiers (LT, RT, etc.) when required

- `*Example:** A patient has an E/M visit (99214) and a minor procedure (11200) on the same day. AI adds modifier 25 to the 99214 to indicate the E/M was separately identifiable, preventing bundling denial.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Place of service updates" icon="location-dot">
    AI corrects place of service (POS) codes based on encounter type:
    - Office visits should be POS 11
    - Telehealth should be POS 02 or 10
    - Hospital inpatient should be POS 21
    - Emergency department should be POS 23

- `*Example:** Encounter is documented as a telehealth visit but POS code shows "11" (office). AI changes to POS 02 (telehealth), ensuring proper processing and compliance with payer telehealth policies.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Charge optimization" icon="dollar-sign">
    AI identifies opportunities to maximize appropriate reimbursement:
    - Suggests higher-level E/M codes when documentation supports it
    - Unbundles procedures that can be billed separately
    - Adjusts units when services were rendered multiple times

- `*Example:** Documentation supports a 99214 level visit but claim shows 99213. AI recommends increasing to 99214, resulting in ~$50 more reimbursement. You review the documentation to confirm this is appropriate.`

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to evaluate AI suggestions

Not every AI suggestion should be accepted. Here's how to evaluate them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the sparkle">
    Click the sparkle icon (✨) next to any field to open a details panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the AI's reasoning">
    The panel shows:
    - **What changed:** Original value → AI-suggested value
    - **Why AI made this change:** The rule or logic that triggered the change
    - **Expected impact:** How this affects reimbursement or claim success
    - **Confidence level:** High, Medium, or Low confidence in the suggestion

`Read this carefully before accepting or rejecting.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Cross-reference with documentation">
    Open the patient's chart or encounter notes. Verify that:
    - The AI's suggestion matches what was actually documented
    - The service level or code change is supported by clinical details
    - The change doesn't misrepresent what happened during the encounter

`<Warning>
**Never accept an AI suggestion that inflates the claim beyond what's documented.** This is billing fraud, even if AI suggested it. You're responsible for accuracy.
</Warning>`

</Step>
  <Step title="Consider payer-specific requirements">
    Ask yourself:
    - Does this payer have specific rules about this code or modifier?
    - Have you seen this payer deny claims for this type of AI suggestion before?
    - Is there a payer-specific edit that AI might not know about?

`Use your biller expertise to override AI when you know payer-specific quirks.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Accept or reject the suggestion">
    **Accept if:**
    - AI's reasoning makes sense
    - Documentation supports the change
    - The change complies with payer requirements
    - You understand the impact and agree with it

- `*Reject if:**
Documentation doesn't support the change
You know the payer has specific rules that contradict the suggestion
The change seems to inflate the claim inappropriately
You're unsure and need to consult a senior biller or coding specialist
Click **Accept** or **Reject** in the details panel.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Document your decision (especially for rejections)">
    If you reject an AI suggestion, add a comment explaining why:

`"Rejected AI suggestion to add modifier 25 because the E/M was minimal and not separately identifiable from the procedure. Documentation doesn't support billing both."

This helps your team understand your reasoning and improves AI over time.`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
**High confidence AI suggestions** are almost always correct and are based on clear-cut rules (like fixing invalid codes or correcting zip codes). **Low confidence suggestions** require more careful evaluation and often involve judgment calls about medical necessity or code selection.
</Tip>

### How blocking rules protect you

Blocking rules are AI-powered validations that prevent you from submitting claims with known problems. Unlike sparkles (which suggest improvements), blocking rules actively stop submissions until issues are fixed.

### What triggers blocking rules

<Card title="Missing required information" icon="circle-exclamation">
**Triggers when:** Critical fields are empty or invalid

**Common examples:**

- Missing patient date of birth
- Invalid or expired insurance member ID
- Missing or invalid provider NPI
- Required authorization number is blank

**Why it's blocked:** Claims with missing required info are auto-denied by payers. Submitting them wastes time and delays payment.

**How to fix:** Fill in the missing information from your practice management system, patient records, or by contacting the patient/payer directly.
</Card>

<Card title="CHC compliance violations" icon="shield-halved">
**Triggers when:** Community Health Center (CHC) compliance rules aren't met

**Common examples:**

- Missing sliding fee discount documentation for qualifying patients
- Incorrect encounter types for CHC reporting
- Services billed that aren't covered under CHC grant funding

**Why it's blocked:** CHC compliance is required for federal grant funding. Non-compliant claims put your organization at risk.

**How to fix:** Review your CHC compliance guidelines and update the claim to meet requirements. Often requires documenting patient income or changing how the service is billed.

<Info>
**Note:** CHC blocking rules only apply if your practice is a federally qualified health center (FQHC) or community health center. Non-CHC practices won't see these blocks.
</Info>
</Card>
<Card title="Known payer rejections" icon="hand">
**Triggers when:** AI detects claim characteristics that this specific payer consistently rejects

**Common examples:**

- This payer requires modifier 25 on all E/M + procedure combinations (but you didn't add it)
- This payer doesn't cover this procedure for this diagnosis code
- This payer requires pre-authorization for this service but none is documented

**Why it's blocked:** Based on historical data, this claim has an 80%+ chance of denial. Better to fix it now than resubmit later.

**How to fix:** Follow the blocking rule's guidance to add required modifiers, change coding, or obtain necessary authorizations.
</Card>

<Card title="Internal organization rules" icon="building">
**Triggers when:** Your organization has configured custom rules based on your specific policies

**Common examples:**

- High-dollar claims ($5,000+) require supervisor review before submission
- Certain procedure codes require specific documentation attached
- Services from certain providers need additional quality checks

**Why it's blocked:** Your organization has decided these claims need extra scrutiny before submission, usually to protect revenue or ensure compliance.

**How to fix:** Follow your organization's internal process (e.g., get supervisor approval, attach required documentation, complete quality checklist).
</Card>

### What to do when a claim is blocked

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the blocking message carefully">
    When you try to submit a blocked claim, you'll see a clear error message explaining:
    - Which rule blocked the claim
    - Specifically what's wrong
    - What you need to do to fix it

Example: "Claim blocked: Missing required authorization number for procedure 99205. This payer requires authorization for new patient visits. Obtain authorization before resubmitting."

</Step>
  <Step title="Determine if you can fix it immediately">
    Ask yourself:
    - Can I find the missing information quickly (in PM system, patient chart, etc.)?
    - Is this something I have authority to fix, or do I need supervisor help?
    - Do I need information from an external source (payer, provider, patient)?

- `*If you can fix it now:** Proceed to fix the issue
*If you can't fix it now:** Assign the claim to the appropriate person (supervisor, prior auth specialist, etc.) and move to your next claim`

</Step>
  <Step title="Fix the blocking issue">
    Make the required changes based on the blocking message. This might involve:
    - Adding missing data fields
    - Correcting invalid codes
    - Attaching required documentation
    - Getting supervisor approval
    - Obtaining payer authorization
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attempt submission again">
    After fixing the issue, click **Submit** again. If you fixed it correctly:
    - The blocking rule should no longer trigger
    - The claim will submit successfully

If the claim is still blocked:

- Read the new error message (it may be a different issue)
- Or verify you actually saved your corrections

<Check>
**Verify:** Submission success message should appear, and the claim status should change to **Submitted**.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
**Never try to "work around" blocking rules** by changing codes or information in ways that don't reflect reality just to get the claim to submit. Blocking rules exist to protect you and your practice from known problems. If a rule is consistently blocking valid claims, report it to your team lead so the rule can be adjusted—don't circumvent it.
</Warning>

### Difference between blocking rules and error flags

It's important to understand the distinction:

| Feature | Blocking Rules | Error Flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Prevent submission of claims with critical issues | Highlight potential problems for review |
| **Severity** | Critical - must be fixed | Warning - should be fixed |
| **Submission** | Cannot submit until resolved | Can sometimes submit despite flags (not recommended) |
| **Trigger** | AI detects known submission failure conditions | AI detects data quality issues |
| **Icon** | 🛑 Red "blocked" badge | ⚠️ Yellow or red warning icon |
| **Action** | Must fix before proceeding | Should fix, but system allows submission |

**Best practice:** Treat all error flags as if they were blocking rules. If AI flagged it, there's a reason. Fix it before submitting even if the system technically allows submission.

---

### When AI modifies claims (and why)

AI doesn't just suggest changes—it also automatically modifies certain aspects of claims before submission. Understanding when and why these automatic modifications happen helps you trust the process and catch any issues.

### Pre-submission automatic modifications

These modifications happen automatically when you click **Submit**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Billing rules application" icon="gavel">
    **What happens:** Your organization's configured billing rules run automatically before submission, modifying the claim to optimize reimbursement and comply with payer requirements.

- `*Common modifications:**
Adding modifiers based on procedure combinations
Adjusting units billed for time-based or incident-to services
Unbundling procedures that can be billed separately
Applying place-of-service-specific adjustments
*Why it happens:** Manual application of dozens of billing rules for every claim is error-prone and time-consuming. Automatic application ensures consistency and maximizes appropriate reimbursement.
*How to review:** Check the "X rules applied" button in the Submissions tab to see exactly what was modified and why.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payer-specific formatting" icon="file-invoice">
    **What happens:** AI reformats data to match the specific payer's requirements for how they want information submitted.

- `*Common modifications:**
Date formatting (some payers want MMDDYYYY, others want MM/DD/YYYY)
Name formatting (some payers want "LAST, FIRST", others want "FIRST LAST")
Address capitalization and abbreviation standardization
Phone number formatting
*Why it happens:** Each payer has technical specifications for claim file formats. Manual formatting would be impossible to maintain across hundreds of payers.
*How to review:** Preview the claim in PDF format before submission to see exactly what the payer will receive.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contractual adjustments preview" icon="file-contract">
    **What happens:** For payers where you have contracted rates loaded, AI shows you expected contractual adjustments before you submit.

- `*Common modifications:**
Shows expected allowed amount based on contract
Previews patient responsibility calculations
Estimates expected payment amount
*Why it happens:** This gives you visibility into expected reimbursement before submission, helping you catch potential underpayment issues early.
*How to review:** Look at the "Estimated Payment" section in the preview panel before submitting.
<Info>
This is a **preview** only—AI doesn't actually modify charge amounts on submission. It's showing you what to expect back from the payer.
</Info>`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validation and error correction" icon="circle-check">
    **What happens:** AI automatically fixes certain data quality issues that would cause instant claim rejections.

- `*Common modifications:**
Correcting invalid characters in text fields (special symbols that break claim files)
Trimming excess whitespace
Standardizing code formats (e.g., ICD-10 codes with or without decimal points)
Fixing malformed NPIs or member IDs
*Why it happens:** Technical claim file format errors cause instant rejections before payers even look at the claim content. Auto-correction prevents these unnecessary delays.
*How to review:** These changes are typically logged in Change History if they modify actual field values. Most are invisible formatting fixes.`

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When AI doesn't modify claims

It's equally important to understand what AI **doesn't** do:

<Card title="AI never changes clinical decisions" icon="user-doctor">
AI will not:
- Change what service was actually provided
- Alter clinical documentation or medical necessity
- Override your professional judgment about appropriate coding
- Modify claims to inflate reimbursement beyond what's documented

**You remain responsible** for ensuring codes match services provided and documentation supports the claim.
</Card>

<Card title="AI never overrides your explicit corrections" icon="hand">
If you manually update a field that AI previously modified, AI respects your decision and won't change it back unless you explicitly accept a new AI suggestion.

**Example:** AI suggested changing 99213 to 99214. You reviewed documentation and decided 99213 is correct. You changed it back to 99213. AI won't change it to 99214 again on this claim.
</Card>

<Card title="AI never submits without your action" icon="paper-plane">
AI assists and prepares claims, but never actually submits a claim without you explicitly clicking the **Submit** button.

You always have final review and approval before submission.
</Card>

---

### Previewing AI changes

Before submitting any claim, preview exactly what will be sent to the payer, including all AI modifications.

### Using the preview feature

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Preview button">
    From the encounter details page, click **Preview** (usually at the top right near the Submit button).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your preview format">
    Select between:

- `*Standard View:**
Shows claim data in the same format as the Content tab
Easy to scan and verify individual fields
Highlights AI changes with sparkles
Best for quick verification
*PDF View (CMS-1500 or UB-04):**
Shows the claim exactly as it will appear to the payer
Professional claim form format
Shows how data maps to form boxes
Best for final detailed review before submission`

</Step>
  <Step title="Review all AI modifications">
    In the preview, look for:

- `**Sparkles (✨):** Fields where AI suggested improvements
**"Changed by rule" indicators:** Fields modified by billing rules
**Highlighted fields:** Any data that was automatically corrected
Pay special attention to:
Diagnosis codes and modifiers
Procedure codes and modifiers
Charge amounts and units
Provider and facility information`

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify against source documentation">
    With the preview open and source documentation available:

- `Confirm diagnosis codes match the documented diagnoses
Verify procedure codes match services actually rendered
Ensure units and charges are correct
Check that all modifiers make sense for this encounter
<Tip>
Use dual monitors if available: preview on one screen, documentation on the other. This makes verification much faster.
</Tip>`

</Step>
  <Step title="Check the applied rules section">
    While in preview mode, expand the **"X rules applied"** section (if visible) to see:

- `Complete list of every rule that modified the claim
What each rule changed
Why each change was made
If any rule modification seems wrong, this is your last chance to catch it before submission.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Close preview and proceed">
    If everything looks correct:
    - Close the preview
    - Click **Submit**

If you found issues:

- Close the preview
- Make necessary corrections on the Content tab
- Preview again to verify your corrections
- Then submit

</Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
**Don't skip the preview step** for high-value claims ($1,000+), complex multi-procedure claims, or claims with unusual circumstances. The extra 30 seconds of preview time can save hours of denial resolution work.
</Warning>

### Understanding the PDF preview

When you preview in PDF format (CMS-1500 or UB-04), here's what to focus on:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Box 24 (Procedures and charges)" icon="1">
    This section contains your procedure codes, diagnosis pointers, charges, and units.

- `*Verify:**
Each procedure code is correct
Diagnosis pointers link procedures to supporting diagnoses
Charges are accurate
Units are correct (especially for time-based codes)
All necessary modifiers are present`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Box 21 (Diagnosis codes)" icon="2">
    This section lists all diagnosis codes for the claim.

- `*Verify:**
All documented diagnoses are included
Diagnosis codes are valid and current
Primary diagnosis is listed first
Diagnosis pointers in Box 24 reference the correct diagnoses`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Boxes 1-13 (Patient information)" icon="3">
    This section contains patient demographics and insurance information.

- `*Verify:**
Patient name matches insurance card
Date of birth is correct
Insurance member ID is accurate
Policy numbers are correct
Patient address is current`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Boxes 14-33 (Provider information)" icon="4">
    This section contains provider, facility, and claim details.

- `*Verify:**
Rendering provider NPI is correct
Facility name and address are accurate
Billing provider information is correct
Place of service code matches encounter type
Date of service is accurate`

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Info>
**First time seeing a claim form?** The CMS-1500 form looks intimidating with 33 numbered boxes, but you'll focus on the same 10-15 boxes for most claims. After reviewing a few dozen claims, you'll know exactly where to look.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with AI assistance and validation, you'll encounter issues that need troubleshooting. This section covers the most common problems and how to resolve them.

---

### Claims stuck in a status

**Problem:** A claim has been in the same status for an unusually long time (e.g., "Ready for Review" for 10+ days, or "Submitted" for 60+ days).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Claim Timeline">
    Open the **Claim Timeline** tab to see when the claim last changed status and what events have occurred.

- `*Look for:**
Long gaps between events
Missing expected events (e.g., submitted but no payer acknowledgment)
Recent activity that indicates someone is working on it`

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify assignment">
    Check the **Assigned To** field:

- `*If unassigned:**
This might explain the delay—no one owns it
Assign to yourself or appropriate team member
*If assigned to someone else:**
Contact that person to check status
They may be waiting for information or stuck on an issue
*If assigned to you:**
Review your workload—did this fall through the cracks?
Check if you're waiting on external information (payer, patient, provider)`

</Step>
  <Step title="Review Change History for clues">
    Open the **Change History** tab:

- `Are there recent edits that might explain the delay?
Is someone making repeated corrections (indicating a complex issue)?
Was data overwritten by imports that needs to be re-corrected?`

</Step>
  <Step title="Take appropriate action based on status">
    **For "Draft" or "Ready for Review" status:**
    - Check if required information is missing
    - Verify no error flags are preventing approval
    - Assign to yourself and complete the review

- `*For "Approved" status:**
Check if it's in a batch queue for submission
Verify no blocking rules are preventing submission
Submit the claim if everything is ready
*For "Submitted" status (60+ days):**
Contact the payer to verify they received the claim
Check if the payer processed and you're missing the payment posting
Consider whether this needs to be resubmitted`

</Step>
  <Step title="Escalate if needed">
    If you can't resolve the stuck claim:
    - Add a comment explaining what you've checked
    - Tag your team lead or supervisor
    - Include specific questions: "I've verified the claim is complete and no blocking rules apply. Do we have a system issue preventing submission?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
**Prevention:** Set up a weekly "aged claims" review where you filter for claims stuck in each status for >7 days. Catching these early prevents them from becoming critical issues.
</Tip>

---

### Assignment not working

**Problem:** You try to assign a claim to someone (or yourself) but the assignment doesn't save, reverts back, or shows an error.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify user permissions">
    **Possible cause:** The person you're trying to assign to doesn't have permission to work this type of claim.

- `*Solution:** Choose a different assignee with appropriate permissions, or contact your admin to grant permissions.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Check for locked claims">
    **Possible cause:** Someone else currently has the claim open and locked for editing.

- `*Solution:**
Wait 60 seconds and try again
Contact the person who has it locked to ask them to save and close
If they're not actively working on it, ask admin to unlock the claim`

</Step>
  <Step title="Refresh your browser">
    **Possible cause:** Your browser session is out of sync with the server.

- `*Solution:**
Save any work in other claims
Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
Try the assignment again`

</Step>
  <Step title="For bulk assignment issues">
    **Possible cause:** Some claims in your bulk selection can't be assigned due to permission or status restrictions.

- `*Solution:**
Note the error message which claims failed
Deselect those claims from your bulk selection
Assign the remaining claims successfully
Handle the problematic claims individually`

</Step>
  <Step title="Clear browser cache">
    **Possible cause:** Cached data is causing conflicts.

- `*Solution:**
Clear your browser cache and cookies for the Claims Page
Log out and log back in
Try assignment again
If still failing after all these steps, contact technical support with:
Claim ID you're trying to assign
Who you're trying to assign to
Screenshots of the error message`

</Step>
</Steps>

---

### Filters not returning expected results

**Problem:** You apply filters but the results don't match what you expect, or you're not seeing claims you know should be there.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review all active filters">
    Click the **Filter** button to see your currently applied filters.

- `*Common mistakes:**
You have more filters active than you realized
A date range filter is excluding the claims you're looking for
You filtered by the wrong field (e.g., "Creation Date" instead of "Date of Service")`

</Step>
  <Step title="Clear all filters and start over">
    Sometimes the fastest solution is:
    - Click **Clear All Filters**
    - Verify you now see all claims (or a reasonable subset)
    - Reapply filters one at a time, checking results after each
    - This helps identify which specific filter is causing the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check filter logic for conflicts">
    Some filter combinations are mutually exclusive:

- `*Example conflict:**
Filter for "Status = Submitted" AND "Status = Paid"
A claim can't be both simultaneously, so results will be empty
*Solution:** Use only one status filter at a time, or understand that multiple status filters use "OR" logic (Submitted OR Paid).`

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify date ranges">
    Date filter issues are extremely common:

- `**Too narrow:** "Date of Service" between Jan 5 and Jan 5 only shows claims from exactly that date
**Wrong year:** Accidentally filtering for 2024 instead of 2026
**Wrong date type:** Filtering "Creation Date" when you meant "Submission Date"
*Solution:** Expand your date range or verify you're using the correct date field.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Search for a specific claim you know exists">
    Use the Search bar to find a claim by:
    - Patient name
    - Claim ID
    - Procedure code

If the claim appears in search but not in your filtered view, that confirms your filters are excluding it—work backward to figure out which filter is causing the issue.

</Step>
  <Step title="Check if saved views have stale filters">
    If you're using a saved view that was created weeks ago:

- `The date ranges might be outdated
Status filters might not align with your current workflow
Payer lists might have changed
*Solution:** Edit the saved view to update filters, or create a new view with current criteria.`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
**Hidden filters:** Some views have filters that aren't immediately visible. Always click the Filter button to see ALL active filters before troubleshooting why results look wrong.
</Warning>

---

### Submission errors

**Problem:** You click Submit and receive an error message instead of successful submission.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the error message carefully">
    Error messages usually tell you exactly what's wrong. Common messages:

- `**"Missing required field: [field name]"** → Fill in the specified field
**"Claim blocked by rule: [rule name]"** → See the "How blocking rules protect you" section
**"Invalid diagnosis code: [code]"** → Correct the diagnosis code
**"Unable to connect to payer"** → Temporary technical issue, try again in a few minutes`

</Step>
  <Step title="Fix the specific issue mentioned">
    Based on the error message:

- `Update any invalid or missing fields
Resolve blocking rule issues
Correct formatting problems
Save your changes.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Preview the claim again">
    After making corrections:
    - Click **Preview** to verify your changes
    - Confirm no error flags remain
    - Check that blocking rules are resolved (Submit button should be enabled)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attempt submission again">
    Click **Submit** again after fixing issues.

- `*If successful:** You'll see a confirmation message
*If still failing:** Read the new error message (it may be a different issue)`

</Step>
  <Step title="For persistent submission failures">
    If a claim repeatedly fails submission after you've fixed the stated issues:

- `Add a detailed comment explaining what you've tried
Take screenshots of the error message
Escalate to your team lead or technical support
Include in your escalation:
Claim ID
Error message(s) received
What corrections you've already made
Screenshots showing the issue`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
**Error messages are your friends.** They tell you exactly what's wrong. The most common submission "issues" are actually just error messages that weren't read carefully.
</Tip>

### AI suggestions seem incorrect

**Problem:** AI is suggesting changes that don't make sense for a claim, or is missing obvious improvements.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the sparkle to review AI reasoning">
    Always start by reading why AI made the suggestion:
    - What rule or logic triggered it?
    - What data did AI use to make this determination?
    - What's the confidence level?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify against source documentation">
    Cross-reference with patient chart, encounter notes, and clinical documentation:

- `Does documentation support the AI's suggestion?
Is AI making assumptions based on incomplete information?
Did AI apply a general rule to a situation with specific exceptions?`

</Step>
  <Step title="Consider payer-specific requirements">
    AI's general recommendations might not align with specific payer quirks you know about:

- `*Example:** AI suggests adding modifier 59, but you know this payer prefers modifier XU in specific circumstances.
*Action:** Reject the AI suggestion and manually add the correct modifier. Document why in the comments.`

</Step>
  <Step title="For clearly incorrect suggestions - reject and document">
    If AI is definitely wrong:

1. Click **Reject** on the suggestion
2. Add a comment explaining why the suggestion was incorrect
3. Make the correct change manually

**Example comment:** "Rejected AI suggestion to code 99215. Documentation supports 99214 - visit did not meet 99215 time or complexity requirements."

Your feedback helps improve AI over time.

</Step>
  <Step title="For missing AI suggestions">
    If you notice AI should have suggested something but didn't:

- `Make the correction manually
Add a comment noting what AI missed
Report pattern to your team lead if you see this repeatedly
*Example:** "AI didn't suggest modifier 25, but this E/M + procedure combination clearly requires it per payer policy. Added manually."`

</Step>
  <Step title="Escalate patterns of bad suggestions">
    If AI consistently makes poor suggestions for:
    - A specific payer
    - A specific procedure code
    - A specific provider's claims
    - A specific type of encounter

Document multiple examples and escalate to your team lead. This may indicate:

- AI needs updated rules for this situation
- Your organization's billing rules need adjustment
- Payer requirements have changed and AI hasn't been updated

</Step>
</Steps>
<Info>
**AI is a tool, not a replacement for your expertise.** You're expected to exercise professional judgment and override AI when appropriate. Good billers reject 5-10% of AI suggestions—that's normal and healthy.
</Info>

---

### Claims not appearing in expected views

**Problem:** You created a saved view or applied filters, but a claim you know should appear in the results is missing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify the claim meets all filter criteria">
    Check each active filter against the claim's actual values:

- `Does the claim's status match your status filter?
Is the date of service within your date range?
Is the payer included in your insurance provider filter?
Is the claim assigned as your filter expects?`

</Step>
  <Step title="Check if the claim is in a different view">
    Your saved views are independent:

- `A claim in "My Active Work" won't show in "Recent Denials" unless it also meets those criteria
Switch between views to find where the claim appears`

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify view parameters haven't changed">
    If you're using a saved view:

- `Open the view settings to review saved filters
Check if someone edited the shared view (if applicable)
Verify date filters haven't become outdated`

</Step>
  <Step title="Use Search to locate the claim">
    Search for the claim by patient name or claim ID:

- `If it appears in search, it exists in the system
Compare its actual properties to your view's filters
This reveals which filter is excluding it`

</Step>
  <Step title="Consider recent status changes">
    Claims that move from one status to another drop out of status-specific views:

- `*Example:** You submit a claim that was in your "My Active Work" view. It immediately moves to "Submitted" status and disappears from your view—this is expected behavior.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Refresh your browser">
    Sometimes views don't update in real-time:

- `Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
Check if the claim now appears
Consider that another user might have changed the claim's properties`

</Step>
</Steps>

---

### Payment amounts don't match expectations

**Problem:** A claim was paid, but the payment amount seems wrong—either too low or (rarely) too high.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the Payment Overview">
    Open the claim and go to **Payment Overview** tab.

Expand sections to see:

- Allowed amount vs. billed amount
- Paid amount vs. allowed amount
- Adjustment codes and reasons

</Step>
  <Step title="Check contractual adjustments">
    Most "underpayments" are actually contractual adjustments:

- `*Example:**
You billed $200
Contract allows $150
Payer paid $150
$50 adjustment with code CO-45 (charge exceeds contract)
This is correct payment per your contract, not an underpayment.
*Verify:** Compare allowed amount to your contract fee schedule for this procedure.`

</Step>
  <Step title="Review the Remittances tab">
    Download and read the full ERA:

- `Look for additional explanation codes
Check remark codes for context
Verify adjustment codes are appropriate
Common legitimate adjustments:
**CO-45:** Charge exceeds contract
**CO-97:** Payment adjusted because services were bundled
**CO-253:** Sequestration reduction (2% federal reduction)`

</Step>
  <Step title="Identify true underpayments">
    Red flags for actual underpayments:

- `Allowed amount is BELOW your contracted rate
Payment is less than allowed amount with no patient responsibility
Unexpected denials or reductions with vague adjustment codes
Multiple procedures bundled that should be paid separately`

</Step>
  <Step title="For confirmed underpayments">
    If you've verified the payment is actually incorrect:

1. Document the issue:
   - What you billed
   - What your contract specifies
   - What you were paid
   - Why the payment is incorrect

2. Add a comment to the claim with this information

3. Escalate to your team lead or appeals specialist

4. Your organization will determine if appeal is warranted

</Step>
  <Step title="For overpayments">
    If a payer paid MORE than expected:

- `Verify the payment amount is actually wrong (sometimes contracts have bonuses or quality incentives)
Document the overpayment immediately
Report to your team lead—overpayments must be returned to payers
Do not bill patient for the overpaid amount`

</Step>
</Steps>
<Warning>
**Overpayments are serious.** Federal law requires you to report and return overpayments within 60 days of identification. Failure to do so can result in fraud liability. Always flag overpayments immediately.
</Warning>

---

### Can't find a specific claim

**Problem:** You're looking for a specific claim but can't locate it in any view or filter.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the Search function first">
    Click the **Search bar** and try multiple search terms:

- `Patient first name
Patient last name
Patient first + last name
Claim ID (if you have it)
Date of service
Try variations if initial search fails:
Different name spellings
Maiden name vs. married name
Abbreviated first names (Robert vs. Bob)`

</Step>
  <Step title="Clear all active filters">
    Your filters might be hiding the claim:

- `Click **Clear All Filters**
Try searching again
If the claim now appears, your filters were excluding it`

</Step>
  <Step title="Check if claim is in draft status">
    Claims in draft status might not appear in default views:

- `Filter specifically for **Status: Draft**
Check if the claim appears`

</Step>
  <Step title="Verify the claim exists in your system">
    The claim might not have been created yet:

- `Check your practice management system—was the encounter actually sent to billing?
Verify the encounter date—is it within your billing period?
Ask provider or front desk staff if the encounter was completed`

</Step>
  <Step title="Check if claim was deleted or voided">
    In rare cases, claims are deleted or voided:

- `Check with your billing manager if the claim was intentionally removed
Review any system notifications or emails about claim actions
If incorrectly deleted, it may need to be re-created from your PM system`

</Step>
  <Step title="Contact support with details">
    If you still can't find a claim you believe exists:

Contact technical support with:

- Patient name (first and last)
- Date of service
- Provider name
- Any claim ID or encounter ID you have
- What troubleshooting steps you've already tried

</Step>
</Steps>

## Q&A

Common questions billers have about working with the Claims Page.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know which claims to work on first?" icon="list-ol">
    **Prioritize in this order:**

1. **High-value claims nearing timely filing deadlines** - Sort by claim amount and age to identify these. Missing timely filing means lost revenue.

2. **Claims from your top 3-5 payers** - These represent the bulk of your revenue. Getting them submitted cleanly maximizes cash flow.

3. **Denials less than 30 days old** - These still have time for correction and resubmission within timely filing limits.

4. **Your assigned claims in "Ready for Review" or "Approved" status** - These are queued for your specific attention.

5. **Older claims (10+ days old) in any status** - Prevent claims from aging out by systematically clearing your queue oldest-first.

Create saved views for each priority level and work through them systematically.

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does it mean when I see sparkles (✨)?" icon="sparkles">
    Sparkles indicate AI has automatically improved the claim to maximize reimbursement or ensure compliance.

- `*Common AI improvements:**
Corrected invalid codes
Added appropriate modifiers
Fixed demographic errors like incorrect zip codes
Optimized charge amounts where documentation supports it
*What you should do:**
Click the sparkle to see what changed and why
Review AI's reasoning and verify it makes sense
Accept the change if it's correct, reject if documentation doesn't support it
You're responsible for final accuracy—always verify against source documentation
See the "Understanding AI Features" section for complete details on interpreting and evaluating AI suggestions.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I undo a bulk assignment?" icon="rotate-left">
    **Short answer:** Not with a single "undo" action, but you can quickly reassign claims.

- `*To fix incorrect bulk assignment:**
1. Filter to show the claims you incorrectly assigned
2. Select them using checkboxes (individual or select all)
3. Use Bulk Actions → Assign to reassign them to the correct person
4. The Change History will log both the incorrect and corrected assignments
*Prevention tips:**
Always double-check your filters before bulk actions
Review the "X claims selected" count before confirming
For large bulk actions (50+ claims), consider doing it in smaller batches first to verify your filters are correct`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why was my claim blocked from submission?" icon="hand">
    Claims are blocked when AI detects issues that will definitely cause denials. Common blocking reasons:

- `**Missing required information** - Critical fields like patient DOB, insurance member ID, or provider NPI are blank or invalid
**CHC compliance issues** - For community health centers, claims don't meet federal compliance requirements
**Known payer rejection patterns** - Based on historical data, this specific payer will reject this claim configuration
**Internal quality checks** - Your organization requires additional review for high-dollar or complex claims
*What to do:**
Read the blocking message carefully—it tells you exactly what needs fixing
Fix the specific issue mentioned
If you can't fix it immediately, assign to someone who can (supervisor, prior auth specialist, etc.)
Never try to work around blocking rules—they exist to protect you from wasted work and denials
See "How blocking rules protect you" in the Understanding AI Features section for complete details.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle claims that were denied for medical necessity?" icon="file-medical">
    Medical necessity denials are complex and usually require provider involvement:

- `*Steps to take:**
1. Review the denial reason in Payment Overview - understand why the payer determined the service wasn't medically necessary
2. Review clinical documentation - does the documentation support the medical necessity of the service?
3. Determine if this is a documentation issue or a payer policy issue:
 - **Documentation issue:** Provider didn't document the medical necessity clearly enough
 - **Payer policy issue:** Payer doesn't cover this service for this diagnosis, even with good documentation
4. Options for resolution:
 - **Appeal with additional documentation:** If provider can provide better supporting documentation
 - **Request peer-to-peer review:** Provider speaks directly with payer's medical director
 - **Billing patient:** If service isn't covered and patient was notified via ABN (Advance Beneficiary Notice)
 - **Write off:** If service isn't covered and patient wasn't properly notified
5. Add a comment documenting your findings and tag the provider or team lead
Most medical necessity denials require escalation beyond the biller level—don't try to resolve these independently.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if AI suggests a change that I know is wrong for this payer?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **This is normal and expected.** AI uses general rules but you have payer-specific knowledge.

- `*What to do:**
1. **Reject the AI suggestion** - Click the sparkle and then click "Reject"
2. **Make the correct change manually** based on your knowledge of this payer's requirements
3. **Document your reasoning** in a comment:
 Example: "Rejected AI suggestion to add modifier 59. This payer requires modifier XU instead for this scenario per their 2024 policy update."
4. **Report the pattern** if you see AI consistently making wrong suggestions for this payer—your team lead can work with admins to update rules
*Remember:** You're the expert. AI assists, but you make final decisions. Good billers reject 5-10% of AI suggestions based on their specialized knowledge.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does it typically take for a claim to be paid after submission?" icon="clock">
    **Typical timeframes by payer type:**

- `**Commercial insurance (BCBS, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, etc.):** 14-30 days
**Medicare:** 14-21 days for electronic claims
**Medicaid:** 30-45 days (varies significantly by state)
**Workers' Compensation:** 30-60 days
*Red flags that indicate a problem:**
No payer acknowledgment within 3 business days of submission
No payment or denial within 45 days
Claim status still shows "Submitted" after 60 days
*What to do if payment is delayed:**
1. Check Claim Timeline to verify submission was successful
2. Call payer to verify claim receipt and current status
3. Be prepared to fax/resubmit if payer claims they never received it
4. Document all payer contact in the claim's Activity Feed`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I submit a claim even if there are error flags?" icon="flag">
    **Technically sometimes yes, but you absolutely shouldn't.**

- `*Why error flags exist:**
They indicate data quality issues that will likely cause denials
AI has identified something that doesn't meet payer requirements
Missing information will result in instant rejection
*What happens if you submit despite error flags:**
High likelihood of denial
Wasted time processing the denial
Delayed payment by 30-60 days while you correct and resubmit
Potential impact to your practice's clean claim rate metrics
*Correct approach:**
Treat every error flag as a blocking rule
Fix all flags before submission
If you can't fix a flag, assign the claim to someone who can
Only submit when all flags are resolved and the claim preview looks perfect
The extra 2-3 minutes to fix flags now saves 20-30 minutes of denial rework later.`

  <Accordion title="How do I create a view for just my work across all statuses?" icon="user">
    **Here's how to set up a personal "My Work" view:**

1. Click **Filter** at the top of the Claims Page

2. Set these filters:
   - **Assigned To:** [Your name]
   - **Status:** Select multiple: Ready for Review, Approved, Submitted (hold Ctrl/Cmd to select multiple)

3. Choose your preferred columns to display:
   - Patient Name
   - Date of Service
   - Provider
   - Status
   - Claim Amount
   - Age

4. Sort by **Age** (oldest first) or **Claim Amount** (highest first) depending on your workflow preference

5. Click **Save View** and name it "My Work - All Statuses"

This view shows everything assigned to you across multiple statuses, making it your one-stop dashboard for all your active work.

  <Accordion title="What should I do if a payer says they never received a claim I know I submitted?" icon="question">
    This situation happens more often than it should. Here's how to handle it:

- `*Step 1: Verify your submission**
Go to the claim's **Submissions** tab
Confirm you see a submission record with date/time
Check for payer acknowledgment—did they confirm receipt?
*Step 2: Gather proof of submission**
Download/screenshot the submission confirmation
Note the submission date, time, and confirmation number if available
Get the claim clearinghouse tracking number (if your system provides it)
*Step 3: Document the payer conversation**
Add a comment to the claim: "Called [Payer Name] on [Date]. Rep said no record of claim. Provided submission confirmation #[number]. Rep requested resubmission."
Get the payer representative's name and reference number
*Step 4: Resubmit with documentation**
Resubmit the claim
Include a note in the submission: "Resubmission - original sent on [date] per confirmation #[number]"
Keep all documentation in case of timely filing dispute
*Step 5: Escalate if this happens repeatedly with the same payer**
Document a pattern of "lost" claims
Report to your team lead
Consider whether this payer has technical integration issues that need to be addressed`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I work on a claim that's assigned to someone else?" icon="user-group">
    **Yes, but follow these best practices:**

- `*When it's appropriate:**
The assigned person is out sick/on vacation
It's an urgent high-dollar claim that needs immediate attention
Your team lead asked you to take over the claim
The assigned person explicitly asked for your help
*Proper process:**
1. **Before touching the claim:** Add a comment explaining why you're taking it over
 Example: "Sarah is out today and this is a high-priority claim. Taking over to complete submission."
2. **Reassign the claim to yourself** before making edits - this prevents conflicts if the original assignee returns
3. **Review Change History** to see what the original assignee already did - don't duplicate work
4. **Document your changes** in comments so the original assignee understands what happened when they return
*When it's NOT appropriate:**
"Stealing" easy high-value claims from others' queues
Working on claims without communication when the assignee is available
Taking over without understanding the context of what the assignee was working on`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if a patient's insurance is active before submitting?" icon="id-card">
    **Use the Eligibility section before submitting high-value claims:**

- `*Step 1: Find eligibility information**
Open the encounter details
Scroll to the **Eligibility** section (usually in the right sidebar)
*Step 2: Check coverage status**
Look for:
**Active** = Coverage is active on date of service ✓
**Inactive** = Coverage was not active ⚠️
**Unknown** = System couldn't verify, needs manual check
*Step 3: Verify eligibility date**
Check when eligibility was last verified
If verification is >30 days old, click **Verify Eligibility** to run a real-time check
*Step 4: What to do if coverage is inactive**
Contact patient to verify insurance information
Check if patient has secondary insurance
Confirm date of service is correct
If patient truly had no coverage, this becomes a patient responsibility claim
*Best practice:** Always verify eligibility for claims over $500 before submission. The 10 seconds it takes can prevent a $500+ denial.`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 'unbalanced' and 'denied' status?" icon="scale-balanced">
    These are completely different situations:

- `*Denied status:**
**What it means:** Payer reviewed the claim and refused to pay
**Your action:** Review denial reason, correct the issue, resubmit
**Example:** Claim denied for missing authorization number
**Status appears in:** Main claim status field
*Unbalanced payment:**
**What it means:** The math doesn't add up correctly for a paid or partially paid claim
**Formula:** Billed Amount ≠ (Paid + Patient Responsibility + Adjustments)
**Your action:** Investigate missing payment information or posting errors
**Example:** Payer paid $100, patient owes $20, adjustments are $50, but you billed $200 ($30 is unaccounted for)
**Status appears in:** Payment Overview tab
*A claim can be both:**
Some procedures paid, others denied = claim shows as "Partially Paid" with unbalanced amounts
*When you see "unbalanced":**
Review Payment Overview carefully
Check if payment posting is incomplete
Verify all adjustments and patient responsibility are captured
Contact payer if payment information is genuinely missing`

</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I create separate views for each insurance company I work with?" icon="building-columns">
    **It depends on your workflow, but here's guidance:**

- `*Create payer-specific views if:**
You work primarily with 3-5 major payers
Each payer has significantly different requirements
You process claims in batches by payer
You need to track metrics separately by payer
*Example payer-specific views:**
"BCBS - Ready to Submit"
"Medicare - Denials"
"Aetna - High Dollar Claims"
*Don't create payer-specific views if:**
You work with 20+ payers regularly (too many views to manage)
Your workflow doesn't typically require payer-specific batching
You prefer to work through all claims by status regardless of payer
*Alternative approach:**
Create status-based views ("My Ready to Submit", "Recent Denials")
Use the payer filter dynamically when you need to focus on specific payers
This gives you flexibility without view proliferation
*Best practice:** Start with 4-6 core views based on your workflow, then add payer-specific views only if you find yourself repeatedly applying the same payer filter.`
