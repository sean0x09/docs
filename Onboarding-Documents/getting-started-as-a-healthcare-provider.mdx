---

Welcome to the Athelas Healthcare platform! This guide walks you through everything you need to know as a healthcare provider to get started with your daily workflows.

## Overview

The Chart Note is the essential workflow for providers in our EHR system. It enables you to document patient encounters, record clinical notes, add measurements and goals, and submit claims. This guide covers all the fundamental components and workflows you'll use daily.

### Fundamental Components

Every chart note includes these core components:

- **Plan of Care** - Treatment frequency, duration, and visit count
- **Measurements** - Clinical measurements and assessments
- **Goals** - Patient treatment goals and outcomes
- **Treatments** - CPT codes and interventions

## Navigating to Chart Notes

You can access chart notes in two ways: from an appointment or from a patient's profile.

### From an Appointment

<Steps>
<Step title="Check in the appointment">
To view a chart note, you must first check in an appointment for the patient.

</Frame>

<Warning>
A Case must be present before you can check in an appointment. If no case is assigned, you'll receive an error when attempting to check in. Add the relevant case via the dropdown menu or create a new case for the appointment.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Complete required fields">
Ensure the following fields are filled before checking in:

- **Case** - Patient case associated with the appointment
- **Appointment Type** - Type of visit
- **Facility** - Location where the appointment takes place
- **Insurance** - Patient's insurance information

## Recording a Note with Scribe

Scribe automatically transcribes your patient conversations and populates the encounter note based on what was said during the visit.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start recording">
Click the **Athelas AI** button in the bottom right corner. A window opens with the option to **Start Recording**. Click it to activate Scribe.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-7.png" alt="Athelas AI button and recording interface" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Record your conversation">
Begin recording your conversation with the patient. While the EHR Scribe widget is open, you can:

- Navigate to other EHR pages on the Athelas website and continue recording in the background
- Click **Minimize** to minimize the widget while it continues recording

<Warning>
You cannot navigate to non-EHR pages while recording. End or cancel the recording first if you need to leave the EHR.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Wait for processing">
After the recording uploads successfully, the system generates a scribe from your recording. This process takes some time. You can:

- Wait for processing to complete
- Close the window and continue with other tasks

## Creating a Plan of Care

The Plan of Care defines treatment frequency, duration, and visit count for the patient.

### Plan of Care Fields

When selecting Plan of Care, you'll be prompted to input:

- **Start Date** - When treatment begins
- **End Date** - When treatment concludes
- **Frequency + Units** - How often treatment occurs
- **Duration + Units** - Length of treatment period
- **Visit Count** - Total number of visits

<Tip>
You don't need to fill all fields manually. If you enter duration + units, frequency + units, and start date, the system auto-populates the end date and visit count. You can override these values if needed.
</Tip>

<Note>
Click the curled arrow icon to pull Plan of Care data from the previous chart note.
