## Understanding Chart Notes

Chart Notes are the core workflow for documenting patient encounters in the Athelas EHR. Each chart note captures everything needed for clinical documentation and billing, including:

- **Plan of Care** - Treatment frequency, duration, and visit count
- **Measurements** - Clinical measurements and assessments
- **Goals** - Patient treatment objectives and outcomes
- **Treatments** - CPT codes and interventions

<Info>
Chart Notes streamline your documentation workflow by organizing all encounter information in one place, reducing time spent on administrative tasks and ensuring complete documentation for billing.

</Frame>

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-12.png" alt="Categorized measurements display" />
</Frame>

### How measurements are organized

Clicking on measurements displays them in categorized order:

- **Grouped measurements** (e.g., LE Neuro Exam) appear together
- **Ungrouped measurements** (marked as "No Associated Group") appear at the bottom
- Click an individual measurement to add it to the chart note
- Click the **+** icon next to a group name to add all measurements within that group

<Tip>
You can view the history of measurements and pull data from previous chart notes if measurements exist for the patient. This saves time when documenting follow-up visits and helps you track changes over time.
</Tip>

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-13.png" alt="Measurement history and previous note data options" />
</Frame>

## Set patient treatment goals

Goals track patient treatment objectives and outcomes, helping you monitor progress and document treatment plans effectively. Unlike measurements which capture current clinical status, goals define what you and the patient aim to achieve.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a goal">
Click **+ Add Goal** in the Goals section. Alternatively, click the curled arrow icon to pull goals from the previous chart note.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-14.png" alt="Goals section with add goal button" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Enter goal details">
A window opens where you can input goal information. Enter the details and click **Add Goal** at the bottom of the window.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-15.png" alt="Goal entry form with fields for goal details" />
</Frame>

<Check>
The goal appears in the Goals section of your chart note.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Scribe can automatically detect goals from your transcription and extract values and specifications, reducing manual data entry.
</Note>

## Create a Plan of Care

The Plan of Care defines treatment frequency, duration, and visit count for the patient, ensuring accurate documentation of the treatment plan. This differs from goals (which define objectives) and measurements (which capture current status) by specifying the treatment schedule and timeline.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-16.png" alt="Plan of Care form with input fields" />
</Frame>

### Plan of Care fields

When selecting Plan of Care, you'll be prompted to input:

- **Start Date** - When treatment begins
- **End Date** - When treatment concludes
- **Frequency + Units** - How often treatment occurs
- **Duration + Units** - Length of treatment period
- **Visit Count** - Total number of visits

<Tip>
You don't need to fill all fields manually. If you enter duration + units, frequency + units, and start date, the system auto-populates the end date and visit count. You can override these values if needed.
</Tip>

<Note>
Click the curled arrow icon to pull Plan of Care data from the previous chart note, saving time on follow-up visits.

</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Track compliance with checkmarks

Compliance checkmarks track specific details that must be captured within the chart note, helping you ensure complete documentation. They can be configured for any template in the EHR. Unlike templates which provide structure, compliance checkmarks verify that required information is actually filled in.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-26.png" alt="Compliance checkmarks showing grey and green status indicators" />
