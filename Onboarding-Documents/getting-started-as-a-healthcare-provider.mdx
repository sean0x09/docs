#### Navigating Chart Notes

The Chart Note is the essential workflow for a Provider within our EHR. In this section, we outline the notable features for proper usage including navigating to the chart note, recording a note via Scribe, adding measurements, goals, treatments and exercises, locking and signing your note:

**Fundamental Components of our Chart Note**

- Plan of Care
- Measurements
- Goals
- Treatments

###

#### Navigating to the Chart Note

To view the chart note for a patient, you must first check in an appointment for the patient you'd like to conduct the for.

**Note:** *In order to check in an Appointment a Case must be present. This means that the user should add the relevant case to the Appointment so that a Chart Note can be created***.**

If there is no given case, the user will receive an error when trying to check in.

You may enter add this via the drop-down or go ahead and create a new Case in correspondence to the Appointment

**Required Fields for an Appointment :**

- Case
- Appointment Type
- Facility
- Insurance

**Alternatively, you can navigate to the chart note via the patient's profile:**

Click on "Patients" on the left hand menu and type in the patient's name into the search bar.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-3.png" alt="" />

You'll be automatically be routed to the Appointments page of the patient's profile.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-4.png" alt="" />

If an appointment has yet to be checked in, the status will indicate that it is scheduled with a checkmark next to it. Clicking this checkmark will **check in** a patient.

If an appointment is checked in, the status will indicate as such. Clicking on the box icon with an arrow sticking out of the top right corner will **open up the chart note**.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-5.png" alt="" />

Once you open up your Chart Note you will be greeted with the following Buttons to allow for the appropriate base set-up.

#### Recording a Note

Scribe is a powerful tool which will allow the conversation with your patient to be auto-populated into the encounter based on what was said.

Click the bottom right "Athelas AI" button - a window will open up with the option to "Start Recording", click this to activate Scribe.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-7.png" alt="" />

Record your conversation. While the EHR Scribe widget is open, you can navigate to other EHR pages on the Athelas EHR website and continue to record in the background. However, you will not be able to navigate to non-EHR pages unless you end/cancel the recording. You can click "Minimize" to minimize the widget. It will continue to record in the background while minimized.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-8.png" alt="" />

When you're ready to upload the recording, click "End Recording".

- After the recording is successfully uploaded, it will take some time for the backend to generate a scribe from your recording. At this point, you are free to wait for generating to finish, or close the window and do something else.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-10.png" alt="" />

Once generating completes, click "View Scribe" to view generated outputs

#### Measurements

Here is an example of how Measurements will appear within the Chart Note

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-11.png" alt="" />

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-12.png" alt="" />

Clicking on measurements will display them in a categorized order.

**Left Image:** LE Neuro Exam-related Measurements are grouped together and below the ones with *No Assoc*i*ated Group* will be anchored at the bottom. Clicking on the individual measurement will add it to the chart note, but clicking on the + icon on the right side of the group name will add all measurements within the group.

An important point to note is that the user will also have the ability to view the History of Measurements and pull data from the previous chart note for measurements if it exists for a patient.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-13.png" alt="" />

#### Goals

This is the Goals section: To add Goals, click "+ Add Goal". Additionally, clicking the curled arrow will pull data from the previous chart note for goals.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-14.png" alt="" />

A window will open up, allowing you to input the details of the goal. Once you've entered the information, click on "Add Goal" at the bottom of the window.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-15.png" alt="" />

Note: Scribe will be able to pick up the following Goal and discern the Values + Specifications based off of your transcription.

####

#### Plan of Care

When selecting Plan of Care, the user will be prompted to input:

- Start Date
- End Date
- Frequency + Units
- Duration + Units
- Visit Count

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-16.png" alt="" />

You are not required to input all of the fields as some auto-population exists. For instance, if duration + units, frequency + units and start date are inputted- the end date and visit count will auto-populate based off the information listed. However, the option to override this is also available.

Clicking on the curled arrow icon will also allow you to pull data from the previous chart note for plan of care.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-17.png" alt="" />

#### Home Exercise Programs

By clicking the checkbox for an intervention marked as `HEP` , this will add this to a staging area where a Home Exercise Program can be prepared.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-18.png" alt="" />

- Clicking the caret for HEP will open up the dropdown to assign any additional notes to the HEP section on a per intervention basis.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-19.png" alt="" />

- You can "Preview and Send" to email, text and print the PDF

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-20.png" alt="" />

#### Templates in Chart Notes

Templates are what you will be primarily utilizing to note down information during the patient's encounter. This is includes SOAP notes, initial evaluations, or any other specialized fields the user would need to capture within the chart note and will be categorized under *Selected Sections*.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-21.png" alt="" />

These templates are able to be scribed into as well. In the case where you'd like to clear all the information from the template, click on Clear on the top right corner of the template section.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-22.png" alt="" />

Additionally, a warning will pop up after clicking on Clear to ensure that you want to delete the templates contents. This guards against any accidental data deletion.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-23.png" alt="" />

Clicking on the trash icon will delete the template altogether. This is helpful if you no longer need the section or accidentally added a template.

<img src="/images/Onboarding-Documents/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider/getting-started-as-a-healthcare-provider-24.png" alt="" />

Similarly to clearing a template, a warning will pop up after clicking this icon to ensure that you want to delete the entire template.

#### Compliance Checkmarks

Compliance checkmarks are a feature within Air that can be configured for any template within the EHR. They are used to track specific details that should be captured within the chart note. If the detail is not captured, the compliance checkmark will be a grey color. If it is the icon will turn green. You have the ability to either type in this information or utilize scribe.
