Once a Chart Note has been completed, this will be visible within the *Appointments* Section of the Patient Demographic. A user can utilize the Status field to validate the stage of a given Chart Note.

Once the Appointment is in a *Completed Status* you will have the ability to download the document. It will change from a gray eye icon to a black eye icon to indicate that you can. We offer both a **Medical Billing PDF and a Plan of Care PDF.**

After the user downloads the Chart Note they will be able to see the following document, depending on the selection.

#### Example of a Billing PDF
