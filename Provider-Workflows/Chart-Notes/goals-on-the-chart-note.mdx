### Goals in the chart note

Goals are a common tool for healthcare providers to track the progression of patient recovery over an extended period of time. On the chart note, the Goals section lives inside of the “Plan” section of SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment, plan).

Below is an image of a goal on the chart note.

### What is included in a goal?

Each goal contains the following

- A goal title – this is where you give your goal a name
- A goal description – this is where you outline the goal details
- An initial value (optional) – here you can add what state the patient was in when you initiated the current goal
- A current state (optional) – here you can verbally update how the patient is progressing towards this goal
- A progress slider – here you can pull the slider to represent progression of goal completion with a percentage.
- A goal tracker – here you can see progression of the goal over time.

### Adding goals

When you open an initial evaluation chart note, if the goals section is set up to be included in your note, it will appear blank until goals are added. To add a new goal, simple click on “New Goal” button and fill out the desired information.

If your note already has goals, you can add additional goals by clicking on the “New Goal” button in the top right corner of the chart note section.

### Removing Goals

If you want to remove a goal, move your cursor over the goal card and a delete icon (trash bin) should appear to the right of the goal. Click on this button to delete the goal. You will be prompted to confirm your decision.
