title: "Sign a Chart Note"
---

This section will compile all the compliance checkmarks within the chart note for a quick overview. If any of them are grey, the information was not captured within the chart note. This is also where the user can select co-signers under “Additional Providers” and for the rendering provider to sign as well.
