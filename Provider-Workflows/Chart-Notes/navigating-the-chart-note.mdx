To view the chart note for a patient, you must first check in an appointment for the patient you’d like to conduct the appointment for. Navigate to Patients tab on the left navigation bar, select appointments, and select “Check in”

Alternatively, you could take action in the Appointment Details section within the Calendar in the left navigation bar.

**Note:** *In order to check in an Appointment a Case must be present. This means that the user should add the relevant case to the Appointment so that a Chart Note can be created***.**

If there is no given case, the user will receive an error when trying to check in.

**Required Fields for an Appointment :**

- Case
- Appointment Type
- Facility
- Insurance

**Case Set-Up:**

Upon the creation of an Appointment, a case will need to be present. If a user is creating a new case the **only required field** is the Case Name. However, since insurance is a required field within the Appointments page, we recommend that insurance priority is set if possible.

Once Checked-in, you can open the chart note via “View Note”

**Alternatively, you can navigate to the chart note via the patient’s profile:**

Click on “Patients” on the left hand menu and type in the patient’s name into the search bar.

You’ll be automatically be routed to the Appointments page of the patient’s profile.

If an appointment has yet to be checked in, the status will indicate that it is scheduled with a checkmark next to it. Clicking this checkmark will **check in** a patient.

If an appointment is checked in, the status will indicate as such. Clicking on the box icon with an arrow sticking out of the top right corner will **open up the chart note**.
