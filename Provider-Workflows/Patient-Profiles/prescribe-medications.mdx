#### Prescribing Medications - how to enable prescribing an uncontrolled substance for a provider:

You can prescribe and manage medications by brand or generic name, including both controlled and non-controlled substances, through SureScripts integration

Navigate to Preferences tab, select Medications and Nominate Provider in the top right. After clicking the "Nominate Provider" button select the provider and facility for which you want to nominate the provider.

This nomination is required because to prescribe an uncontrolled substance, you require a *Surescripts Prescription Identifier* (SPI) number.

Once these requirements are fulfilled, the provider can start prescribing uncontrolled substances.
