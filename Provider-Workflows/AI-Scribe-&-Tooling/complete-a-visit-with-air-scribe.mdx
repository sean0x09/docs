Scribe is a powerful tool which will allow the conversation with your patient to be auto-populated into the encounter based on what was said.

Click the bottom right “Athelas AI” button - a window will open up with the option to “Start Recording”, click this to activate Scribe.

Record your conversation. While the EHR Scribe widget is open, you can navigate to other EHR pages on the Athelas EHR website and continue to record in the background. However, you will not be able to navigate to non-EHR pages unless you end/cancel the recording. You can click “Minimize” to minimize the widget. It will continue to record in the background while minimized.

When you’re ready to upload the recording, click “End Recording”.

- After the recording is successfully uploaded, it will take some time for the backend to generate a scribe from your recording. At this point, you are free to wait for generating to finish, or close the window and do something else.
