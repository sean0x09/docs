The appointments tab is where you can see all upcoming and past appointments for the patient. You are also able to create new appointments here, though you are able to do so on any tab in the patient’s profile as well.

This list of appointments can be easily filtered by clicking on the *Filters* icon which will open up a side panel with several options.

Selecting a date, or date range on the calendar will only show appointments for the date(s) selected. Additional filters include:

- Providers
- Cases
- Facilities
- Appointment Status
You can combine different filters to find specific appointments that the patient has/ had.

#### Faxing Through Appointments

You can easily bulk fax and download PDFs by clicking on the checkbox at the very top of the appointments table. All of the completed appointments will have a checkbox next to them. You’ll be able to uncheck any that you don’t want to download or simply check the boxes next to the appointments you’d like to download or fax.
