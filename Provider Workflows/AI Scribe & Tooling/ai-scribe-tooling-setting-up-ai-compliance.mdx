<p>Compliance checkmarks are a feature within Air that can be configured for any template within the EHR. They are used to track specific details that should be captured within the chart note. If the detail is not captured, the compliance checkmark will be a grey color. If it is the icon will turn green. You have the ability to either type in this information or utilize scribe.</p><img alt="" src="/images/setting-up-ai-compliance/setting-up-ai-compliance-1.png" />
