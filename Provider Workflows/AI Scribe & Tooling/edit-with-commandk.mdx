---

Command-K is a useful feature aimed at helping you quickly rewrite sections of the chart note.

You will be able to split sections into bullet points, summarize sections to make them more succinct, or change the tone of text (eg, narrative) through this quick toggle.

**Important:** command-k only works in text sections of the chart note
