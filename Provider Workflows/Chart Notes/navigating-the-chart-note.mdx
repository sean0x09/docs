This means that the user should add the relevant case to the Appointment so that a Chart Note can be created</em>**.**</p><p><br /></p><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-the-chart-note/navigating-the-chart-note-3.png" /><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-the-chart-note/navigating-the-chart-note-4.png" /><p>If there is no given case, the user will receive an error when trying to check in.</p><p><strong>Required Fields for an Appointment :</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Case</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Appointment Type</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Facility</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Insurance</p></li></ul><img alt="" src="/images/navigating-the-chart-note/navigating-the-chart-note-5.png" /><p><strong>Case Set-Up:</strong></p><p>Upon the creation of an Appointment, a case will need to be present.
