How to Use Universal Search in Insights

<h3>At a Glance</h3><p>Insights has a universal search feature. You can use it to find anything and everything in Insights - pages, patient profiles, individual encounters you want to edit, etc.</p><p>We recommend using it all the time—we certainly do so ourselves!</p><h3>Here’s How to Do It</h3><p>To open the universal search window, you can either:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Click the search icon in the header of any page in Insights, or</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Hit <strong>Ctrl + K (or Cmd + K for Mac users).</strong></p></li></ol><p>Then, start typing to find the information you need.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/LP8xLJqFboyzl6ZiQs7qXxBGRA.png"><p>In this example, we can see that by simply typing the patient’s name, the list populates with many options related to that patient:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>EHR information (this will only appear if your practice uses Athelas’ own EHR)</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Patient Profile</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Appointments</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Claim details</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Subscription plan</p></li></ul><p>…and many more options.</p><p>The options at the bottom of the search window, <code>Create a patient payment plan</code> and <code>EOB Creation</code>, will simply bring you to those pages. They currently will not show information specific to your search results.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/dKTHUZkHu3It4znsPKzr2VTSs.png"><p>You can also search with Encounter IDs, page titles, feature names, or anything else you want.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/BIv8q6ipwh2VHYIPZrVLRSSsIKY.png"><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/OJ6KbaU22iGWDlqG2oNz4kEofQ.png"><h3>In Conclusion</h3><p>Using the universal search feature will save you a lot of time and frustration from manually clicking around the platform. If you have an identifying piece of information about the thing for which you’re searching, you can use this function to find it right away.</p>
