If so, send them a text message request for payment to give them a belated opportunity to pay. This can catch a lot of lost revenue, and patients are more likely to trust the text message if it comes the same day as their appointment.</p><p><strong>Features Supported:</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Send out communication to multiple patients at once</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Filter patients that will receive communication by appointment date ranges, providers, patients and insurances</p></li></ul>
