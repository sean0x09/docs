How to Refund a Payment

<h4>Walkthrough</h4><p>Navigate to the patient’s profile.</p><p>There are two ways you can view the payment: the Charges tab, or the Transaction History tab.</p><p>The process is the same for both. For this example, we’ll use the Charges tab.</p><p>Look for the transaction in question and click <code>View Details</code>.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ykPibYIBr1cZvDFL7VhCQSxdf9w.png"><h3>Refund the Payment</h3><p>On the Transaction Details table, find the specific transaction you want to refund and click the <code>Refund Payment</code> button.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/p8uKYueDkZQzGVV5EhtWPVQqHtA.png"><p>Specify whether this is a full or partial refund, the method of refund, amount (if partial), and reason for the refund in the popup.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/eMEsXnbdSeQxdbjNLcj6HWC03fA.png"><p>When selecting the Refund Method, you have the following options:</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/75I3nDA78utfaCAIAw7zLoxEvhI.png"><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Add Credit to Patient’s Account</strong></p><p>This payment will become credits on the patient’s account, and will be applied to future balances due.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Refund to Credit Card (via Stripe)</strong></p><p>If a patient originally paid with their credit card via the Stripe card reader provided by Athelas, this is the go-to option for straightforward refunds!</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Record External Refund (Cash/CC)</strong></p><p>This is how you record a cash or credit card refund (if the card payment was taken outside of the Athelas card reader).</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Record External Check Refund</strong></p><p>If you’re choosing to pay the patient back with a check, use this option to record that the refund has taken place.</p></li></ul><p>Once you’ve entered all the necessary information, click <code>Refund</code>.</p><h3>Refund Complete!</h3><p>You should now see a new row in the transaction table showing the refund you just triggered.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/hUSabAQEJaaKOCwDuWRX9UrgI.png"><p>If you refunded to credits, that new credit will appear in the  patient's ‘Credits’ tab.</p><p><strong>Important Note: Leftover PR</strong></p><p>When you refund a payment in Athelas Insights, that does not automatically remove any patient responsibility associated with the payment</p><p>For example, when you collect a $75 Self-Pay payment for an appointment, Athelas automatically creates a $75 unit of PR linked to the payment. If you then refund the $75 payment, that leaves behind the PR creating a balance due.</p><p>To erase <em>both the payment and its implied PR</em>, you will need to go into the Charges tab and cancel the PR as well. </p>
