How to Use the Posting Tool Page

<h4>Overview</h4><p>When it comes to remittances, the vast majority of posting can be handled by Athelas' automated posting systems. However, payers occasionally send malformed, duplicate, or conflicting data in their remittances. Athelas’ systems will flag these cases for manual review, either by our operations team or your practice’s staff. The Athelas Posting Tool is designed to give you more flexibility and control over remittances that are either marked for manual review or that you want to adjust manually.</p><p>Here's a short demo:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QBWhvrnKDL0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1" data-thumbnail="Medium Quality" frameborder="0" allow="presentation; fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h4>How It Helps?</h4><p>The Athelas Posting Tool is designed to <strong>simplify and streamline manual posting</strong>, giving your team the tools to handle exceptions and adjustments quickly, accurately, and with full visibility. Here’s how it helps:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Reduces Manual Errors:</strong> Preview Mode lets you see the impact of every action before it’s posted, helping prevent mistakes.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Centralizes Financial Activity:</strong> Procedure-level and claim-level payments are displayed in one place, providing a complete view of an encounter’s financials.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Supports Complex Adjustments:</strong> Actions like Negations, Write Offs, Write Off PR, Push to PR, and Custom Adjustments let you manage exceptions efficiently.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Audit-Friendly:</strong> Every action is tracked separately, preserving a clear history of postings for internal reviews and compliance.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Improves Productivity:</strong> Encounter and payer-level rollups highlight totals and discrepancies, so your team can focus on the items that need attention most.</p></li></ol><p>By providing visibility, control, and safety checks, the Posting Tool helps your team post remittances confidently while maintaining accurate financial records.</p><h4>Key Concepts</h4><figure><table><tbody><tr><th><p><strong>Term</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Description</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Encounter / Claim</strong></p></td><td><p>A single patient visit or claim that may include multiple procedures. The Posting Tool supports both procedure-level and encounter-level posting.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Procedure</strong></p></td><td><p>A specific service provided during an encounter (e.g., a lab test or office visit).

Actions are the main way to <strong>correct, reclassify, or apply financial activity</strong> at both the procedure level and the encounter (claim) level.</p><p>Each action is designed to be <strong>transparent and reversible</strong> through Preview Mode, giving you full visibility into how changes will affect the ledger before committing them.</p><h6>Key Principles</h6><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Actions apply to specific items</strong> – Each row in the Payment Items Table or Unposted Remittances Table represents a single payment, adjustment, or remittance. Actions are taken on a row-by-row basis.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Preview first</strong> – All actions generate a preview row so you can review changes before posting. This ensures that mistakes can be corrected early and balances remain accurate.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Audit-friendly</strong> – Every action you take is tracked separately in the ledger, preserving a clear history of all adjustments and postings.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Multiple levels supported</strong> – Actions can be applied to both <strong>procedure-level items</strong> and <strong>claim-level items</strong>, depending on the financial activity being managed.</p></li></ul><p>In the sections that follow, you’ll see detailed instructions for each type of action: <strong>Posting Remittances, Archiving/Unarchiving, Negations, Write Offs, Write Off PR, Push to PR, and Custom Adjustments</strong>.

There are two primary actions you can take on these items: <strong>Archiving/Unarchiving</strong> and <strong>Posting</strong>.</p><h6>Archiving/Unarchiving</h6><p>Archiving lets you set aside remittances without posting them. This is useful when:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The remittance is a <strong>duplicate</strong>.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The remittance is <strong>incorrect or irrelevant</strong> for the current encounter.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>You want to <strong>declutter your workspace</strong> before posting.</p></li></ul><p><strong>How it works:</strong></p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Locate the remittance in the <strong>Unposted Remittances Table</strong>.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Click the <strong>Archive</strong> button in the Actions column (right-most column of the table).</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/yChohR28c0LMHBJ2eRo4bNYRI.png"></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The remittance will be moved to the bottom of the table, with an “archived” label and will be grayed out.</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/yySWkonRB8ZI0bLW3mW1YJDBZA.png"></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>To restore an archived remittance, click the <strong>Unarchive</strong> button in the actions column</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/SJwMpAUi0e26XRX2Wb71oMT7OY.png"></li></ol><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Archiving a remittance will also mark its status as finalized</p></li></ul><h3>Posting</h3><p>Posting a remittance moves it into <strong>preview mode</strong> so that it can be applied to the procedure or claim payment ledger.
