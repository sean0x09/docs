Adding Prior Auth and Alerting

<h4>How to Add Prior Authorization </h4><p>If a patient enters the clinic with a new prior authorization, you can easily add that information on their appointment details. Click on <em>Add</em> next to <em>Prior Auth (Primary)</em>. A new window will appear showing all of the patient’s prior authorization numbers.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/DXpwI5s6lkraKDZQHuzgHexDTd0.png"><p>From here, click on +Create on the top right corner and fill out the prior authorization details. After saving the information, you’ll return back to the window. The prior authorization that will tie into the appointment is the one checked off.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/0Gzk9PhyuSyVVKb8Zhb1JHoDkc.png"><p>You are also able to add prior authorization numbers within the patient profile in the demographics tab.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Evl8tvWGfAY5T9hSWmTRMay7s.png"><h4>Prior Authorization and Visit Count Alerting</h4><p>Air has built in alerting surrounding prior auths, annual visits and Medicare threshold limits. When effective dates near their expiration date, or visits are running low- you will receive an orange alert. If the appointment is past the effective date, or no longer has any visits remaining you will receive a red alert.</p><p>Annual visits, along with prior authorization effective dates and visits can also be edited within this section directly.</p><p>When each section is expanded, detailed explanations of the alerts will appear for more context. The pencil icons will allow you to edit or update any of the information directly in this section.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ovhvTGX0OIQHdUC0lByTBkY3jU.png"><p>Adding an annual visit limit for a new service type will be done here by clicking to the same pencil icon. You’ll be able to select the service type and even include a custom plan year start date- meaning you’ll start the year from a unique date instead of January 1st of that year.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/rbgrv9p94FyeCgQI5t2XeA6BTc.png">
