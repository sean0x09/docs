How to Cancel PR

<h4>What PR is Cancelable?</h4><p>Cancelling patient responsibility removes it entirely, as if it never existed. For this reason, some types of PR can be cancelled and others cannot.</p><p><strong>Cancelable PR:</strong> Any type of patient responsibility that was created by your team, or that did not originate from a remittance, can be cancelled. For example:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Self-Pay PR Created when your team collects self-pay payments.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Custom Charges Any custom PR types that your team has created in Insights.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Placeholder PR When you collect up-front copay, coinsurance, or deductible, Athelas creates placeholder PR which will be replaced once a Remittance comes in.</p></li></ul><p>These can be cancelled, but will be replaced once a remittance arrives.</p><p><strong>Non-Cancelable PR</strong>: Once we get a remittance, the <strong>PR derived from that remittance can no longer be cancelled</strong>. However you can still update that PR in 2 ways:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Write Off PR:</strong> You have the option to reduce the amount of PR due. This is distinct from cancellation in that you are saying that the PR is still due, but your team has accepted that some/all of it will never be paid (vs. it should have never existed in the first place).</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Upload a New Remittance:</strong> If the claim’s remittance information is incorrect or out of date leading to incorrect PR, you can upload a new EOB/Remittance. Once the new remit data is imported, the claim’s PR will automatically update overnight based on the newly imported data.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Here’s How to Do It</h3><p>Navigate to the patient’s profile.</p><p>Under the Charges tab, find the row you want to cancel and click ‘View Details’.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/0s4XQ93miC0kyaPZArzhLuG0dk.png"><p>Click the <strong>‘Cancel PR’</strong> button.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/aDZrXlkeX8K9HwIJFvYUrdcKwM.png"><p>This will open the <strong>cancel patient responsibility window.</strong> Select any or all parts of the PR you wish to cancel. Then click the <strong>‘Confirm’</strong> button ****to finalize your cancellation.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/KEUm19X55RlCB7Demcche08qmSY.png"><h3>Cancellation Complete!</h3><p>You will now be returned to the Charges sub-tab, and the PR you cancelled should no longer appear in the list of charges. Nice work!</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p><strong>Help! It still won’t let me cancel PR!</strong> </p><p>If the PR you’re trying to cancel has a *disabled ‘*Cancel PR’ button but you know it should be cancelable, hover your mouse over the button to get a <strong>tooltip</strong> that will explain what the issue is.</p><p>Most often the PR has already been paid, and the payment will need to be refunded before the PR can be cancelled.
