Viewing multiple providers

<h4>How are providers displayed on the calendar?</h4><p>In the 1 day and week views, providers are displayed as columns on the calendar view. Each column displays the providers name at the top, along with a summary of how many appointments that provider has today.</p><h4>How to add/remove providers from the calendar</h4><p>You can add or remove providers from the calendar view by clicking on the filter icon, at the top of the calendar, and locating the “Providers” filter. Add providers by searching for their names and selecting them from the dropdown. Remove already present providers by clicking the “X” on their name in the text box.</p><p><em>Note: when searching for providers, you will see a subtext under their name indicating how many appointments they have today. If you see “0 appointments” this means they have no appointments today <strong>at the currently selected facility</strong>. This does not mean they don’t have appointments at other facilities.</em></p><p>Learn more about filter on the calendar <a href="/documentation/filter-the-calendar-view">here</a>.</p>
