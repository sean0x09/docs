Designate Staff as Provider Agents

<h4>Problem Statement</h4><p>Providers can prescribe medications in the EHR, but given their busy schedules, they often don’t have time to fill out multiple fields and submit prescriptions themselves. Instead, they rely on staff, typically MAs, to draft prescriptions for later review and sign-off, or to directly prescribe when the medications are not controlled.</p><h4>Solution</h4><p>Providers can designate staff members as <strong>prescriber agents</strong>, granting them the ability to <strong>draft prescriptions for controlled medications</strong> and <strong>prescribe non-controlled medications</strong> on their behalf. Providers can assign prescriber agents by facility and set permissions for whether they can only create draft prescriptions or also prescribe medications.</p><p>When a draft prescription is created, providers receive a task notification on the notification bell. Clicking the notification takes them to the <strong>Tasks</strong> page, where they can view the associated patient profile. From there, they can navigate to the patient’s profile page and review the draft prescriptions under the <strong>Medications</strong> section.</p><h4>How it helps?</h4><p>Providers save time by just signing off on medications instead of creating them. As part of MA’s day to day tasks, they create medications via this feature.</p><h4>How to use this feature?</h4><h4>Prerequisite</h4><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Provider should have the facilities they want to prescribe for</p><p>EHR &gt; Preferences &gt; Provider</p></li></ol><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/BEOEWt6fDcBYXmvP7rq2StEcRR4.png"><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Provider should be nominated for the facilities they want to prescribe medications -</p><p>EHR &gt; Preferences &gt; Medications &gt; Provider Nominations</p></li></ol><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/GS4bhZpH0d4sAaQb8EUjCGdOs.png"><h4>Step 1 - Add prescriber agents for the provider</h4><p>Go to : EHR &gt; Preferences &gt; Medications &gt; Prescriber Agents</p><p>Click on “Add Prescriber Agent”</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/u3S4xn35IA0o4yKubU1a9ICTg.png"><p>You will see yourself as the provider selected by default.

Save draft is the only option they can select if they are ineligible to prescribe for that facility, or if they are dealing with controlled medications.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/GZu6DwxS0p0suod5UErVtKogyP0.png"><p>On review, the medications which are marked as save as draft will show up as Draft</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/YLQsv4yKLDsgUtbZP1POfCDHV18.png"><p>Once they submit the medications, the draft medications will appear on the medications table, and a confirmation toast will show the information of the medications created.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Q0AHPStMCMpVALRslH2r8rSDg8U.png"><p>There will also be created a task created for the provider which the provider can refer to to sign off on the medications.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/YwBfs5Reqezenk4P43XuP2UfUI.png"><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/DwpnzQ9D0WGYJYpJbEwmVi7dQw.png"><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/D7oBW5a6y6uNGv4fLFUI9H7oMUY.png"><p>Prescriber agent can edit the draft medications, but they cannot prescribe draft medications once they have created the draft.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/4FLZyeUbm9UYSKl6VVyPNcWAE.png"><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/3ZD4QVh4rTBEHOvL8mMvIwrnMKg.png"><h4>Providers can also make changes to draft, but they cannot save drafts, they can only prescribe them directly.</h4><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/DM19zxjMYSWKEoLjLW2ss3c.png"><h4>Video  1 - Create/Update medications as prescriber agent and provider</h4><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lew72frKPPM?iv_load_policy=3&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1" data-thumbnail="Medium Quality" frameborder="0" allow="presentation; fullscreen; accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h4><br></h4>
