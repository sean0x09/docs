The Denials Analysis Page

<h4>At a Glance</h4><p>The goal of the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/payment/denials-analysis">Denials Analysis</a> page is to give your practice clear, accurate, and prompt visibility into denials metrics.</p><p>With this information, you can track how your practice and Athelas are working together to minimize denials over time, as well as the amount of revenue recovered through successful claim resubmission.</p><p><br></p><h2>Information Available in Denials Analysis</h2><h4>Overview</h4><p>In the top left corner of the page, you will find a <strong>calendar filter</strong> that you can adjust to only see denials from a specific time frame.</p><p>Below that, the page features overall metrics of Denials Resubmitted, Resubmitted Payments Recovered, and the Overall Denial Rate. The industry standard denial rate is 11%, so anything below that means you’re recovering more money from denials than the average.</p><p>You can also filter results by other metrics, such as whether denied claims fall into Athelas Responsibility, Site (your practice) Responsibility, Processing, etc.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/gQrAUHU8BlnULzIzP4V9O0t8Qs.png"><h4><br></h4><h4>Historical Denial Rate</h4><p>On this bar graph, you can see your practice’s monthly denial rate. Hover your cursor over one of the bars to see the exact ratio of denials against other claim outcomes. The dotted red line marks the aforementioned 11% industry standard denial rate.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/yd8sHBlCzEJTs9NlR0ijT6UUsg.png"><h4><br></h4><h4>Denial Dollars Saved</h4><p>Now, we get to the exciting part where you get to see exactly how much money you have collected from denials with Athelas.</p><p>As with the previous page, hover your cursor over a bar for details, and filter results by owner status in the top right corner of the graph.</p><p><strong>What’s the difference between Resubmitted Payments Recovered and Denial Dollars Saved?</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Resubmitted Payments Recovered</strong>: Insurance payments for claims previously denied and resubmitted, summed as 'payments recovered.’</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Denial Dollars Saved</strong>: Monthly difference between potential denials at industry standard rate (11%) and the rate of actual denials at your organization. &lt;/aside&gt;</p></li></ul><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/3CQN8c3g5knClRlKnOV7QqeFQ.png"><h4><br></h4><h4>Denials Resubmitted</h4><p>This graph shows how many denials have been edited and resubmitted. This will give your practice a better picture of the work Athelas is doing behind the scenes that may not otherwise be apparent.</p><p>You can filter this information in the top right corner to show monthly or weekly results.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Sp45EvS5p6etbWTMw1mgf8SYaw.png"><p>To <strong>resubmit a single claim</strong>, please refer to <a href="https://athelas.helpkit.so/how-to-guides/mx4v4WBLUG3MERujomrLhL/how-to-resubmit-a-single-claim/bxqSBf42n6PRH8Qqdwvgoa">this guide</a>. <br>To <strong>resubmit claims in bulk</strong>, check out <a href="https://athelas.helpkit.so/how-to-guides/mx4v4WBLUG3MERujomrLhL/how-to-resubmit-claims-in-bulk/od27wsaBqiSDZURfT5VQwz">this one</a>.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>Looking for More Data?</h4><p>If you’d like to see another denials metric displayed on this page, please get in touch with your account manager!
