How to Write Off a Balance

<h3>Write Off PR (Procedure Only Action)</h3><p><strong>⚠️ Currently, Write Offs can only be applied to procedure-level Payment Items.</strong></p><p>A <strong>Patient Responsibility Write Off</strong> removes a balance that was assigned to the patient but should no longer be collected. This is typically used when your organization decides not to bill the patient for a portion of their responsibility (copay, deductible, or coinsurance).</p><p>Like payer write offs, this is a <strong>net-zero operation</strong>: the amount is moved out of the corresponding <strong>Patient Responsibility</strong> column and into the <strong>Other Adjustments</strong> column. This reduces the <strong>outstanding patient balance</strong> on the encounter by the written-off amount.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong></p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Locate the remittance with a patient responsibility balance (copay, deductible, or coinsurance) you want to write off in the <strong>Payment Items Table</strong>.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Open the <strong>Actions</strong> menu (three-dot menu in the right-most column) and select <strong>Write Off PR</strong>.</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Gut5hKmQcraBttFdTNCnZui4e4.png"></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Enter a reason for the write off <strong>and specify the amount to write off for each PR CARC</strong>.
