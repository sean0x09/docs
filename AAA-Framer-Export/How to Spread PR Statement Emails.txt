How to Spread PR Statement Emails

<h3>At a Glance</h3><p>When <strong>all of your patients with outstanding PR receive an email and/or text message about it on the same day</strong>, it can create headaches for your office staff as they try to navigate a <strong>deluge of calls</strong>, and it becomes harder to deliver satisfactory service to patients.</p><p>Setting up your patient communications to be delivered evenly throughout the week, rather than just on one day, can <strong>alleviate pressures like this and set your patients and staff up for success</strong>.</p><h3>Here’s How to Do It</h3><p>On the <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v2/pr-statements">Patient Statements</a> page, scroll down to Settings.</p><p>Here, you’ll see a wide range of customization options — Auto Reminder Frequency, Contact X% of Patients per Batch, etc.</p><p>There is also a checkbox you can click to <strong>Use Recommended Settings</strong>.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/OR44cqxPHraeEwWlSqzq6Ym2v64.png"><p>By default, <strong>Athelas recommends contacting 50% of patients with outstanding PR, distributed evenly on weekdays, no more than once every two weeks.</strong></p><p>Let’s break down what that means.</p><p>Every seven days, Athelas’ systems find all patients with outstanding PR. It then runs those patients through any filters you may have set — which facility they visited, their provider, their age, and, most importantly, <strong>whether they have already been contacted within the past X days.</strong></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/MFEpRMwF7y3EpxvM9UwxFG2B64.png"><p>Athelas recommends contact no more than once every 14 days.</p><p>This is called a ‘<strong>batch</strong>.’</p><p>The recommended settings then tell the system to contact 50% of that batch, but spread out over each of the selected weekdays.</p><p><strong>For example</strong>, if a full batch includes 100 patients, then 50% of that would be 50 patients. Divide those 50 patients into even groups over five weekdays, and we get 10 patients per day scheduled to receive PR collection texts.</p><p><em><strong>Important Note:</strong> Athelas defaults to <strong>sort patients by Time Since Contacted Decreasing</strong> (i.e. priority is given to the ones contacted least recently), to ensure no patient falls through the cracks. If instead you would like to <strong>sort by Balance Decreasing</strong> (i.e. priority is given to the ones that owe the most PR), you can choose that option.</em></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/aonsSrWuDmRJvwxPqucek0HDx2w.png"><p>Once customized your filters to your liking, click the <strong>Preview</strong> button to check that everything looks correct, and make changes if necessary, before saving.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/0l29OUmnfeXx3VCXwTx0W9vbM.png"><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/tWJjEX0WMd6cZvbJoXfEZIPXYWk.png"><p>When you’re satisfied with your settings, click <strong>Save Setting</strong>.</p><p>Done!</p>
