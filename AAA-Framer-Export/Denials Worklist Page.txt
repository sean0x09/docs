Denials Worklist Page

<h3>At a Glance</h3><p>The <a href="https://insights.athelas.com/v3/denials">Denials Worklist page</a> is designed to point you directly at the most impactful denials to work, helping you maximize revenue collection for your practice.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/rf6QYJxTH68E80ErNVEbn9oN0ec.png"><h4>Best Practices</h4><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Check the Denials Worklist daily. New remittances come in all the time, along with new denials that require your team’s expertise.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>When you’ve corrected a claim in your EHR, mark it as ‘Updated in EHR!’ This signals Athelas to grab the updated claim info and resubmit.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Click into individual claims to review the notes left by the Athelas Denials Team. Often these will tell you exactly what action is needed.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Periodically, someone on your team should review the ‘Not Workable’ category to either write these denials off, or take one last shot at correcting them.</p></li></ol><h4>Full Features Overview</h4><p>The Denials Worklist page displays claims that require&nbsp;<em><strong>action</strong></em>. Any claim that has already been resolved (from resubmissions to write-offs) is excluded&nbsp;<em>by default</em>&nbsp;in order to provide a clear line of sight on the most impactful claims to work.</p><p><strong>However, although your worked claims are hidden by default, they’re always just one click away in the </strong><a href="https://www.notion.so/Denials-Worklist-Page-1-23ef92a633f280438709cc617fd63372?pvs=21"><strong>Worklist Settings</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h4>Header Tabs</h4><p>The top of the Denials Worklist page displays three tabs:</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/Mv1UkbKbxqTZZoLsxGXU5YF91Y.png"><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Site Action Required</strong></p><p>Denials in this category will be your top priority. Your practice is responsible for making necessary updates in your EHR and then marking claims as ‘Updated in EHR’ (see example walkthrough below for directions). Once the correct updates have been made, these claims will be resubmitted automatically within 24 hours.</p><p> </p><p>💡 You’ll also notice these filters on the Site Responsibility tab:</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/iSnoOlzwJEKiFuT3LYgAlG2zDo.png"><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Not Started</strong></p><p>These are denials on which no action has been taken.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Awaiting EHR Updates</strong></p><p>These are claims where your staff has indicated that corrections have been made in the EHR. Once our importers have pulled in the corrections, these claims will automatically be resubmitted, and will disappear from the denials dashboard.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Blocked</strong></p><p>Claims enter this status when a member of your team indicates that they need assistance from Athelas to resolve the claim. <strong>If you’re stuck and need help, mark the claim as Blocked.</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Athelas Responsibility</strong></p><p>Denials in this category will be worked and resubmitted by Athelas. No action is required on your part.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Not Workable</strong></p><p>Denials are listed as ‘Not Workable’ if there are no available actions that will lead to approval (generally, things like duplicate claims and those that are too old to meet timely filing requirements end up here). Your practice should review and then <a href="https://athelas.helpkit.so/how-to-guides/mx4v4WBLUG3MERujomrLhL/how-to-write-off-a-balance/3BJBM9vJnjVt9VFRJrNwzA">write off</a> these claims.</p></li></ul><h4>General Filters and Settings</h4><p>The next items on the page are the General and Denial Detail filters, as well as the Worklist Settings. Use these to narrow your search and pinpoint the denials you want to view.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/DAjxKV9W3jh9jhv4qN4BeVe4Ak.png"><p><br></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>General</strong></p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/W770BGTLDBqcs5R34YTWEeG8afk.png"><p>The Insurance Priority filter (in which you can specify Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary) is always active by default. You can add the following filters to your search as well:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Service Date Range</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Latest Submission Date</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Latest Date Posted</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Facility</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Provider</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Patient</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Billing Type</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Denial Detail</strong></p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/iGwDbO2CCNWTH12gnITmPraYJY.png"><p>By default, the Denial Type filter is active, and you can switch between Full or Partial Denial. You also have the option to filter your list by Reason, CARC, and/or RARC.</p><p>Toggling on the <strong>‘Denials with Notes’</strong> will display only denials for claims on which someone has written a note.</p><p>The <strong>‘Your tagged Denials’</strong> toggle will display only denials on which someone tagged your username in a note.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Worklist Settings</strong></p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/cYut9iXmzAmlOcD3vSZTjI2RDAM.png"><p>Using the&nbsp;<strong>Worklist Settings</strong>, you can add any resolved denial type back into the mix. Your options include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Decision Pending, Encounter Finalized, Unposted Remittances, Inconclusive Remittances, Missing Recon, Overposted Encounters, Voided Denials, Capitation Denials, Appeals Filed, Medical Records Sent, and Reprocessing claims.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these settings also includes an explanation of exactly why this denial type is excluded from the Denials Worklist (and how Athelas is addressing them, if need be).</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/CcNAQnVYfkfUMus79DLBCoFHIcs.png"></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Denials by Month</strong></p><p>This section allows you to see monthly denials data at a glance. It also acts as a monthly filter—simply click on a month so that the list below displays only that month’s denials, and click the month once more to revert.</p><p><br></p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/xHtkgND9xOTNFduX3l6RTInuKA.png"></li></ul><h4>Denial Reason Clusters</h4><p>The dashboard is designed around a central organizing principle: solving one issue should resolve multiple claims.</p><p>We use two types of codes provided by the payer to identify denial causes:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCS)</strong></p><p>These describe the main cause of the Denial. Some of these are sufficiently vague that additional detail is needed, which is why we also get…</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Remittance Advice Reason Codes (RARCS)</strong></p><p>These optional codes provide a greater level of specificity that helps identify the root cause of the denial.</p></li></ul><p>The dashboard groups your claims into CARC/RARC clusters, unifying all the claims with similar denial reasons so you can review them together.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/DTlWLxU22GshHTFJCiHPLSjStY.png"><h4>View the Notes for Clues!</h4><p>While you’re viewing an individual claim, be sure to check any related notes left by either your coworkers or Athelas staff. These notes often describe the action required and/or the reason a member of your staff is needed to resubmit the claim.</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/3b06FRloQpijR6TDX9IzHDuTvw.png"><h4>🔁&nbsp;Example Walkthrough: Working Denials for Resubmission</h4><p>Let’s look at this group of denials as an example case:</p><img alt="" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/5HuzRJICCmKTRCJvlDqhfpCyX0.png"><p><br></p><p>These eight claims were all denied due to the CARC CO-197, indicating that they were missing prior authorization upon submission.</p><p> 💡<strong>The solution:</strong></p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Update their prior authorizations individually</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Mark them as <code>Updated in EHR</code> in bulk </p></li></ol><p><strong>1. Update Prior Authorizations</strong></p><p><strong>The first move to make here would be to update prior auth in your EHR.</strong> That way, Athelas can pull that information directly within 24 hours, ensuring no discrepancies between Athelas and your EHR.</p><p>However, if you want to resubmit sooner than that, you can update prior auth manually in Insights as well.</p><p>There are two primary ways to update prior auth in Insights:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>From the </strong><a href="https://athelas.helpkit.so/how-to-guides/mx4v4WBLUG3MERujomrLhL/how-to-find-and-edit-a-patient%E2%80%99s-profile/k7Tz4h9MSHwdJ8LzVkJJCS"><strong>Patient Profile</strong></a></p><p>Visit the patient’s profile and click into the ‘Prior Authorizations’ tab.
