####

#### Summary

The **Claim Adjustments Report** provides a detailed view of adjustments applied to each patient encounter.

It is especially helpful for practices dealing with **multi-payer claims**, as it clearly separates adjustment activity for **primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary** payers.

Use this report to identify recurring adjustment reasons, improve billing processes, or support reconciliation workflows.

####

#### Notes

- Each encounter may appear multiple times (once per payer).
- Adjustments are grouped at the **payer level**, not by individual procedure or line item.
- No totals or pivots are included — these can be calculated after download (e.g. in Excel).
