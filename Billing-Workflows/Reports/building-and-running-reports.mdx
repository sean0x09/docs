#### At a Glance

This overview contains general information about the [My Reports](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/my-report) page in broad strokes. Administrators and Billing Managers should be able to **run a report on most information available in Insights, presented in one comprehensive bundle**. Then, that report can be easily downloaded as a CSV and edited in a spreadsheet at will.

Detailed information about specific reports is available by clicking the `?` icon next to each report.

#### Example

Let’s say we want to run a report to find all posted insurance payments for the past two weeks.

First, click on the download icon for `Posting Log`.

<img src="/images/Billing-Workflows/Reports/building-and-running-reports/building-and-running-reports-4.png" alt="" />

Set the Date Type to `Date Posted` and the Start and End Dates to the past two weeks. For this example, we’ll leave the rest of the fields blank.

Then click `Download`.

The reports will appear in your Downloads folder on your hard drive, or wherever you route new downloads by default.

<img src="/images/Billing-Workflows/Reports/building-and-running-reports/building-and-running-reports-6.png" alt="" />

From here, you have access to several tabs with posted payment information organized in various ways:

- Insurance Payments Summary
- Insurance Payments
- Check Summary
- Patient Payments Summary
- Patient Payments

This example report, and all others available on the My Reports page, allow you to view and manipulate data as needed at both the overhead view level and the granular, individual level.
