### Overview

Most healthcare businesses require daily cash drawer reconciliation so that any discrepancies between expected and actual dollars can be accounted for on each day of service. The **Reconciliation** feature makes this process simple.

***Important: this guide details physical cash drawer PR reconciliation only (cash and check PR payments, not credit or other payments)**.*

To view total payments for a given date or range of dates, refer to the ‘Patient Responsibility’ section of the [Revenue Analysis page](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/payment/revenue-analysis) and set filters for the information you need.

You can also visit the [My Reports page](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/my-report) and download a transaction report, in the ‘Revenue’ section, for the day(s) you would like to review. Be sure to check or uncheck ‘Show credit payments*’ depending on your needs.

**This refers to payments made with credits already on a patient's account, not credit card payments. Credit card payments are already included in reports.*

In the New Run tab, note that you can filter by facility and user, along with date/time range.

Now, Athelas’ systems compare the cash and check dollars in the drawer with the expected amount of each.

If there is a difference between the Closing Amount and Expected Amounts, you’ll see that difference highlighted in the **Discrepancies** **column**.

You will also be able to see an itemized list of payments, with details available if you click into a payment, including Associated DoS, Payment, and Amount Recommended.
