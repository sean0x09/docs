When it comes to understanding your calendar, what you’re really trying to do is get a good sense of what your day looks like in an instance’s glance, and this is exactly how it should be. The less time you need to decipher your calendar, the more time you can spend assisting patients along their healthcare journey.

Navigate to the Calendar in the left Nav Bar

#### Appointment Stages:

As appointments move through their different stages, the blocks will reflect the designs below. Some advantages:

- Easier to see canceled appointments
- Completed appointments fade from the schedule so you can focus on scheduled/confirmed appointments
