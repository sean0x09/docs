Intake forms can be sent out directly on the appointment details to the patient directly. On the appointment details side panel, click on *Send* to the right of Reminders/Forms.

Clicking on this button will cause a window to pop up with the option to send specific intake forms or a workflow.

You can send out intake forms through text, email or both. This information will automatically populate based on what was set in their patient demographics. However, you are able to change the email or phone number directly in this window. Doing so will alert you, and provide a way to easily revert the change by clicking on *Reset to Patient Number/Email*.
