You can sort tasks by column by clicking the arrow in the column header. Columns will sort by increasing values, decreasing values, and neutral upon each click.

You can also *shift-sort* by sorting on one column, then holding shift and sorting on a second column.

If you want to view **Archived** tasks, you can use the Filter in the upper right corner and include them in the Statuses shown.

You can edit, delete, or update the status of a task by simply clicking the corresponding icon on that task.

Finally, you can check the boxes of multiple tasks to perform actions in bulk.
