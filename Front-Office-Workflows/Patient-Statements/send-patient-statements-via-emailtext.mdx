### Time to Send a Statement - Email or Text

#### Email a Payment Request

- Let’s say you’ve got all your patient’s information squared away and it’s time to collect payment. If you choose to send an email, this is what the patient will receive:

- If they choose to Pay Online, they will be taken to a pre-filled login page, except for their date of birth which they enter manually:
