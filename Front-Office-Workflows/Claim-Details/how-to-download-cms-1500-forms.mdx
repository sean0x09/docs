**What is a CMS-1500 (or HFCA-1500) Form?**

The Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA)-1500 claim form, also known as **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)-1500**, enables medical physicians to submit health insurance claims for reimbursement from various government insurance plans including Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare. When a physician has a private practice but performs services at an institutional facility such as a hospital or outpatient facility, the CMS-1500 form would be used to bill for their services.

For more information, visit [[cms.gov](http://cms.gov/)]([https://www.cms.gov/medicare/billing/electronicbillingeditrans/1500](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/billing/electronicbillingeditrans/1500)).
