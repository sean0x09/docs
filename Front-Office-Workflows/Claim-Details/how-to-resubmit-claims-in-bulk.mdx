title: "How to Resubmit Claims in Bulk"
---

This feature can be accessed for claims in the [Submission Errors](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/presubmission-errors), [Rejections](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/rejections) or [Denials Worklist](https://insights.athelas.com/v3/denials) pages. You can also manually add claims directly through the [Bulk Resubmission](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/bulk-claim-resubmit) page.

## Here’s how it’s done

First, check the boxes next to each of the claims you would like to resubmit in a batch. Then, open the Actions menu and choose Bulk Resubmit.

You’ll then decide whether to add these claims to an existing batch for resubmission, or create a new batch.

Once you add the claims to your chosen batch, you’ll see a popup inviting you to the Batch page (the [Bulk Resubmission](https://insights.athelas.com/v2/bulk-claim-resubmit) page).

Fill in the required settings, click Submit Batch. You’ll be able to track the progress of your resubmission in the Processing and Complete tabs on the Bulk Resubmission page.
